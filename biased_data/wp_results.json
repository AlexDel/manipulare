Seven months into a conflict over Ukraine that has seen at least 3,400 people killed, Putin predicted that the clash would not be the last to pit Russia and the United States against each other, excoriating the White House for imposing sanctions against his nation that he said were simply aimed at forcing Russia into submission. In nationally broadcast remarks that lasted nearly three hours, Putin gave no hint of concessions to Western consternation over Russia\u2019s role in Ukraine, where Putin first pressured former president Viktor Yanukovych over his plans to sign a European-friendly trade deal, annexed the Crimean Peninsula after pro-European protesters forced Yanukovych\u2019s ouster and then helped fuel a pro-Russian rebellion in eastern Ukraine. Russia \u201cis not asking anyone for permission\u201d in its conduct of world affairs, Putin said. Although there was little new substance in the angry address, it was a bitter distillation of Putin\u2019s anti-American rhetoric at an annual forum originally intended to put a Western-friendly spin on Russia\u2019s image. Putin speaks every year before the Valdai Club, a gathering of Western and Russian analysts, journalists and officials, some of whom are critical of the Kremlin. This year\u2019s meeting was held in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi.

(Mikhail Klimentiev/Ria Novosti/Kremlin Pool/European Pressphoto Agency)  In the past, Putin has used the forum to offer olive branches to those critics. Last year, he took questions from opposition lawmakers a day after his aides had offered them political concessions. Sometimes he has also made jokes. This year\u2019s speech and question-and-answer session contained none of that image-polishing. Instead, Putin delivered an unsmiling, straightforward worldview that blasted the United States as taking advantage of its powerful post-Cold War position to dictate misguided terms to the rest of the world. Putin faulted the United States for a rise in global terrorism, a resumption of a global arms race and a general worsening of global security. \u201cIt never ceases to amaze me how our partners have been guilty of making the same mistakes time and again,\u201d Putin said, accusing the United States of breeding terrorists by upsetting the established order in Syria, Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan. One participant said that he was left with the impression that the ouster of Yanukovych in Ukraine \u2014 a nation with deep historical and cultural ties to Russia \u2014 was the final straw that unleashed years of anti-Western anger. \u201cIt was an emotional broadside against U.S. foreign policy,\u201d said one participant, Cliff Kupchan, a longtime Russia analyst who is chairman of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political and business consultancy. \u201cIf this is a turning point,\u201d Kupchan said, \u201cwe\u2019re going from bad to worse.\u201d Kupchan said that other meetings with Russian officials over the closed three-day conference left little optimism for a durable peace in Ukraine, where a Sept.\u00a05 cease-fire has frequently been broken. He said that officials at the meeting saw Cyprus and Bosnia as models for handling Ukraine\u2019s divisions. Neither is an exemplar of comity between ethnic groups. Russian officials also said that they still will not tolerate Ukraine\u2019s establishing stronger ties with the European Union, suggesting that a 15-month delay in the effective date of a landmark trade deal simply delays yet another confrontation between Russia and Ukraine, Kupchan said. Putin offered brief praise to recent instances of Russia-Western partnership, such as removing Syria\u2019s chemical weapons and the ongoing multi\u00adlateral negotiations to halt Iran\u2019s and North Korea\u2019s nuclear programs. But that was just a brief moment in a long anti-Western diatribe. The real audience may not have been the assembled Valdai elite but Putin\u2019s domestic electorate, which thrives on his delivering powerful and angry messages to the West, said Vladimir Frolov, a Moscow-based foreign policy expert and former diplomat. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Friday that \u201cthe United States does not seek confrontation with Russia, but we cannot and will not compromise on the principles on which security in Europe and North America rest.\u201d \u201cOur focus is on continuing to engage with Russia on areas of mutual concern,\u201d she said.

Seven months into the bloody fighting that has seized Ukraine\u2019s east, the rest of this fractious country, long split between competing tugs from Europe and Russia, is pointing its face more than ever toward the West. Ukraine elected the most pro-European parliament in its history Sunday \u2014 in part because the most pro-Russian parts of the country didn\u2019t vote at all. Now some people in western Ukraine wish their nation could just walk away from the rebels who want to be a part of Russia. Residents of Lviv, where Soviet rule never erased elegant Austro-Hungarian architecture, have long been among the most determined in Ukraine to push their nation toward Europe. So the conflict has stirred powerfully contradictory emotions in people such as Sokolov, a leader of pro-European demonstrations here last winter, who wishes that Ukraine could shed the east even as he says that the country should fight to keep it. There are no mainstream voices suggesting Ukraine should actually spin off eastern Ukraine, since many people fear that if they don\u2019t put up a fight, Russia will take as much of Ukraine as it can for itself. But few here in Lviv relish fighting for a territory to which they never felt strong ties. \u201cI never thought Ukraine would be a part of Europe if we had Donbas. It is a depressive Soviet region,\u201d Sokolov said in one of Lviv\u2019s bustling coffeehouses, which are reminiscent of Vienna. \u201cIf we could talk about civilized ways to get rid of that area, I would support it.\u201d   Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists swap 25 fighters from each side, amid a fragile cease-fire in eastern Ukraine. (Reuters)   With Russia backing the rebels against the rest of Ukraine, Sokolov said, the choice is far from simple. Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in March, after protesters ousted Russian-friendly Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Then it helped fuel a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine that has claimed at least 3,700 lives, according to U.N. estimates. \u201cWe\u2019re not fighting for the east. We\u2019re fighting for Ukraine against Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to stop the war there before it spreads to other parts of Ukraine.\u201d Since Ukraine gained its independence in 1991 when the Soviet Union split, control of this nation has seesawed between easterners and westerners. But critics say that national leaders, no matter their origin, were more focused on lining their own pockets than on building a stronger Ukraine. Western Ukraine has long harbored anti-Russian sentiments, and an anti-Soviet insurgency based in Lviv persisted well into the 1950s. The Ukrainian language and the Catholic Church separate western Ukraine from its eastern counterpart, where the Russian language and the Orthodox Church are predominant. After the fall of the Soviet Union, European-oriented western Ukrainians demanded more autonomy from Kiev. That desire crested in February, when anti-Yanukovych protesters, led in part by Sokolov, seized Lviv\u2019s regional administration building, the local outpost of the central government. That meant that when pro-Russian demonstrators in the east did the same thing two months later in Donetsk, some western Ukrainians at first withheld judgment. The escalation into armed conflict quickly obliterated what might have been a more peaceful national discussion about decentralizing Ukrainian authority. \u201cA lot of people are asking how we can live in one country with people who wanted to be part of Russia and were killing us. I don\u2019t have an answer for that,\u201d said Otar Dovzhenko, a journalism professor and blogger at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv who participated in the pro-European demonstrations in the winter. \u201cIn my heart, I feel it would be easier to live apart from these people,\u201d he said. \u201cBy my reason, I know we have to keep fighting for the territory.\u201d Many people in Lviv say that Ukraine\u2019s history, caught between shifting empires, makes them particularly cautious about any discussion of changing their borders. Portions of southwest Ukraine might fly off to Romania, other parts to Hungary. Lviv itself was once a part of Poland, whose border lies just 30 miles away. Poland\u2019s post-Soviet success has helped push Lviv\u2019s attitudes toward Europe. Poland\u2019s economy was about the same as Ukraine\u2019s in 1991 but has since tripled. Former Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski last month told Politico that Russian President Vladimir Putin once spoke to the Polish premier about divvying Ukraine between Russia and Poland. Sikorski quickly retracted the accusation. But the fact that the discussion was even remotely plausible attests to Ukraine\u2019s perilous position. Politicians say they are working to stitch the country back together. \u201cThis problem didn\u2019t appear in a day,\u201d said Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, speaking about eastern Ukraine. \u201cFor 20 years, the Ukrainian government did nothing to make them feel more Ukrainian. And Russia played a good game,\u201d said Sadovyi, who fought on the side of the pro-European demonstrators and whose new Self-Help political party made a strong showing in Sunday\u2019s parliamentary elections. As the conflict in the east escalated over the summer, more and more western Ukrainians volunteered to join the battle, seeing it as an existential threat to their nation. Some of the volunteers came from the Right Sector, the far-right nationalist group whose base is in Lviv and that has been demonized in Russia for ties to neo-Nazism. Some moderates also moved quickly from the pro-European demonstrations to the eastern battlefield. \u201cPeople will fight to the end,\u201d said Nazar, 27, a Lviv native and soldier who was mobilized to fight near the Luhansk airport this summer, the scene of particularly bitter combat. Fearing retaliation, he spoke on the condition that his last name not be published. \u201cIf it were a domestic problem, that would be one thing. But this is a foreign invasion,\u201d he said. Thousands of refugees from the fighting in eastern Ukraine have streamed westward to Lviv, a development that has served as a vivid reminder that not all eastern Ukrainians wanted to secede from Ukraine. Opinion polls conducted in eastern Ukraine before the hostilities deepened showed that most residents there wanted to remain part of a single country. Some in Lviv cite that as a reason they want to keep fighting to preserve the country, although attitudes in eastern Ukraine have probably hardened toward Kiev after months of conflict. The reception for eastern Ukrainian refugees in Lviv and elsewhere has been decidedly mixed. Many refugees say they have been treated poorly by local residents, who blame them for starting the conflict.  Apartment owners \u201cdon\u2019t want to rent to people from the east,\u201d said Yevgenia Ivanova, a former resident of Donetsk who has tried for two months to find an apartment in Lviv where she could live with her husband and 2-year-old son and only moved into one last week.  \u201cThey believe that in total, all people from the east are angry beasts. They don\u2019t understand that not everybody is the same,\u201d she said. Ivanova said she had started to try to speak Ukrainian at home to fit in better. But she also said that many volunteers had helped her with food and supplies. Others are getting more tired of war, including some soldiers. Mothers and wives of soldiers have rallied several times in Lviv to campaign for their family members to be rotated home from the front after long deployments. In Kiev last month, several hundred members of the national guard rallied against mobilization. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t send any more of our boys there. They\u2019re not well-equipped,\u201d said Oksana Alyoshyna, the mother of a soldier who came to a parents\u2019 protest in Lviv last week.  With rebel-held territories set to conduct elections Sunday, Ukraine\u2019s divisions are poised to harden even more. The rest of Ukraine will face the question of how hard to fight for those territories it has lost. \u201cMany people say it\u2019s now more possible to have policy with more perspective, government with more perspective, because these regions kept Ukraine in aSoviet mentality,\u201d said Myroslav Marynovich, the vice rector of the Ukrainian Catholic University. \u201cThose same people would say that they are not for the division of Ukraine. These are diametrically opposed visions.\u201d ", "articleBiased": true, "articleHeader": "In Ukraine\u2019s European core, new weariness over war with pro-Russian rebels"}, {"articleUrl": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ukraine-pro-russia-rebels-hold-elections-in-the-east-fueling-conflict/2014/11/02/73d6ed90-62a3-11e4-ab86-46000e1d0035_story.html", "articleSrc": "WP", "articleText": "  MOSCOW \u2014 Residents of rebel-held eastern Ukraine voted for leaders on Sunday, taking another step toward establishing an independent enclave and exacerbating tensions between Russia and the West. Thousands of residents across war-torn eastern Ukraine lined up Sunday to give their backing to the current rebel leadership, which has been working to establish a new pro-Russian state in the southeast corner of the country. The vote, which was embraced by Russia  and condemned by Western and Ukrainian leaders, will change little in terms of leadership on the ground. But rebels said it would give them a measure of popular support in their negotiations with the central government in Kiev, and it underlined how fully Ukraine has lost control of the region. Rebel leaders have declared that an often-violated two-month-old cease-fire  is dead, and last week they said they plan to take over more territory that is vital for the establishment of their state.  A Ukrainian military spokesman said Sunday that Russian military support had been flowing into eastern Ukraine in recent days, and witnesses on Sunday reported long columns of unmarked military trucks traveling into the rebel stronghold of Donetsk. Ahead of the vote, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would recognize the results.

After the elections, he said, Kiev \u201cwill recognize us, give us our land back without a fight, and we will establish good diplomatic relations.\u201d Zakharchenko, a former electrician at an eastern Ukrainian mine, took over leadership of rebels in the Donetsk region from a Russian citizen in early August. He was running Sunday against two little-known candidates. The leader of rebels in the Luhansk region, Igor Plotnitsky, a Soviet armed forces veteran and former civil servant, also was expected to win. Rebels had no access to voter registration rolls, and anyone could vote at any polling place he or she wanted, as well as online. Polling stations were crowded, with long lines, although there were fewer polling stations than for the Ukrainian parliamentary elections in 2012, and it was difficult to establish meaningful turnout figures. Many residents have fled to other parts of Ukraine and to Russia. Some witnesses saw gunmen at some of the polling stations. At other voting locations, people were selling cut-rate onions, cabbage and carrots. Russian lawmakers loyal to the Kremlin said that after the elections they may step up support for the rebels and the breakaway state they call New Russia. \u201cThe elections that are taking place today are lawful and civilized forms of realizing the right to self-determination for the people of New Russia,\u201d Sergei Zheleznyak, the vice-speaker of Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament, said in a statement on the Web site of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s political party, United Russia. Ukraine\u2019s leaders were far less sanguine about the vote. Ukraine\u2019s Security Service said Sunday that it had launched a criminal inquiry into the elections, and it declared persona non grata several far-right European politicians who had arrived in eastern Ukraine to watch the elections.

Rebels have struggled to find ways to pay civil servants and pensions, for which the Kiev government is no longer footing the bill, in the territory they control The separatist conflict began after Russia-friendly Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted by protesters in February. Russia then annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula, and separatist protesters seized eastern Ukrainian government buildings and territory starting in April. The fighting has killed more than 4,000 people, according to U.N. estimates, including hundreds since the cease-fire went into force Sept. 5.

Now, Russia can ignore that evidence \u2014 as well as any questions citizens might raise \u2014 since President Vladimir Putin signed a decree classifying certain peacetime deaths of soldiers as state secrets. Putin signed an order Thursday making the deaths of Russian troops lost during \u201cspecial operations\u201d a secret, amending a previous decree that limited such secrecy to deaths of soldiers in wartime. Some watchers can see only one plausible reason for the change: Russia is gearing up for another military push into Ukraine.  [Ukraine says it wants a missile shield to protect against Russian aggression]  \u201cWe\u2019re in a pre\u00adwar situation. Right now there\u2019s going to be another campaign in Ukraine,\u201d said Pavel Felgenhauer, a military analyst based in Moscow, who added that Russia was being secret about losses\u00ad because \u201cwe\u2019re fighting a secret war.\u201d But war brings about the sort of casualties that can serve as proof of Russia\u2019s involvement in Ukraine, Felgenhauer pointed out. \u201cIf foreigners know about the losses\u00ad of soldiers in Donbass, that\u2019s not very good,\u201d he said, using a term that refers to eastern Ukraine. \u201cBut more important is that the Russian public doesn\u2019t know. So it\u2019s going to be a secret, as it was in Soviet times.\u201d Russia has long denied its troops are operating in Ukraine, dismissing as fabrications reports of training camps, troop build\u00adups and even the testimony of captured Russian soldiers claiming to be on active duty. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday that the decree is a simple upgrade of state privacy laws that \u201chas nothing to do with Ukraine\u201d and that Putin had no plans to green light a special operation there.  Yet dead and missing soldiers speak to the Russian population louder than NATO satellite images\u00ad tracking Russian troop movements. And last summer, as news of troops returning from Ukraine in caskets reached the Russian people, the government narrowly avoided an internal crisis. Eventually, mothers of Russian soldiers clamoring for information on their sons captured in Ukraine were muzzled, while politicians who publicized the secret funerals and burials of Russian soldiers thought to have died in Ukraine were reportedly beaten. Russia has a history of secrecy surrounding the deaths of troops. The country spares no ceremony celebrating its military victories and prowess, but there are still many families who don\u2019t know what happened to their war dead, in World War II or any of the military campaigns that Soviet troops fought in the decades after. Russians don\u2019t even know how many people who died in those conflicts were civilians vs. soldiers, because the state kept such figures secret. But one thing is sure: Much as they may support Putin\u2019s Ukraine policies, Russians don\u2019t want to repeat the experience of suffering mass losses\u00ad over a conflict in another country. Last year, one state-run poll found that two-thirds of Russians opposed sending troops into Ukraine, while barely more than a quarter of the population supported the idea. Nonetheless, reports continue to emerge about how Russia has been building up its troop presence near the Ukrainian border. A Bloomberg report this week cited U.S. lawmakers claiming that Russia was operating mobile crematoriums in eastern Ukraine to hide its dead \u2014 and thus hide its involvement in the conflict. And then there\u2019s the image that the decree\u2019s terminology \u2014 \u201cspecial operations\u201d \u2014 drums up. \u201cSpecial operations\u201d is \u201ca new term to identify a new reality\" without a legal definition, presidential Human Rights Council member Sergey Krivenko told Russian news outlet RBK on Thursday. But Russians have heard the term before during Putin\u2019s presidency \u2014 in connection with such campaigns as the second Chechen war, the 2008 conflict in South Ossetia and, most recently, last year\u2019s annexation of Crimea.

The deal proposed by Michael O\u2019Hanlon and Jeremy Shapiro in their Dec. 7 op-ed, \u201cA win for Russia, Ukraine and the West,\u201d would not just be misguided \u2014 it would be dangerous. The premise of their argument that a \u201cwin-win-win outcome for Russia, Ukraine and the West is far smarter than zero-sum thinking\u201d runs counter to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s exclusively \u201czero-sum\u201d view of the world. If we have learned anything from the Obama administration\u2019s failed \u201creset\u201d with Russia, it is that Putin unfailingly seeks to exploit the West\u2019s futile pursuit of \u201cwin-win\u201d deals.  To get Putin to behave, O\u2019Hanlon and Shapiro proposed granting him a veto over anything the European Union and NATO would do vis-\u00e0-vis Russia\u2019s neighbors, thereby consigning Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and other countries to a Russian sphere of influence. There would be no more NATO enlargement, and any European Union relationship with Ukraine would have to meet with Moscow\u2019s approval and not interfere with Russia\u2019s Eurasian Economic Union project. Countries join the latter because they face tremendous Russian pressure to do so; they join the European Union and NATO because they see it in their own best interests.  Putin clearly is not interested in seeing Ukraine succeed; in fact, he fears that a democratic, European-oriented Ukraine would pose an attractive alternative to his authoritarian system. Putin undermines his neighbors\u2019 independence and right to pursue deeper integration with the West because of his zero-sum way of thinking. He sees movements calling for liberalization and democracy and against corruption and authoritarianism as threats to his own power. When Viktor Yanukovych, Putin\u2019s partner in Ukraine, fled the country in February, Putin invaded to make sure that Russians wouldn\u2019t get the idea that they could produce a similar result in Moscow. How can one build a new, pan-European security structure, as O\u2019Hanlon and Shapiro proposed, with someone who sees everything the West represents as his biggest threat?  Giving Putin any say over his neighbors\u2019 policies would be the height of irresponsibility, yet O\u2019Hanlon and Shapiro proposed holding a referendum to determine Crimea\u2019s future. Instead, the West should stick to its policy of nonrecognition of Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, even if it takes years to return the region to Ukraine, just as it never recognized the absorption of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union. Since 2004, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have been proud members of NATO and the European Union \u2014 and are no doubt thankful they have security guarantees from the alliance\u2019s Article 5 in light of Russia\u2019s rising threat.  The source of tensions between the West and Russia lies with the nature of the Putin regime. To justify his invasion, Putin fabricated stories that Russian speakers and ethnic Russians, first in Crimea and then in eastern Ukraine, were under threat. In reality, no such threats existed. Putin did not cite NATO enlargement \u2014 in large part because nobody was discussing the idea of Ukraine joining the alliance. NATO had nothing to do with Putin\u2019s decision. To the extent that it exists at all, the prospect of Ukraine\u2019s membership in NATO is a far-off possibility, but O\u2019Hanlon and Shapiro would take it off the table entirely, overturning the alliance\u2019s decades-old \u201copen door\u201d policy. For the first time, a small majority of Ukrainians may want to join NATO. How demoralizing for them if NATO, on top of refusing to provide Ukraine with the military means to defend itself, were to shut the door to membership. Putin would read such a decision as open season on Ukraine and its other non-NATO neighbors.  Russia\u2019s most secure, stable borders are with countries that belong to NATO, the European Union or both. The idea that NATO, a defensive organization, is a threat to Russia is nonsense. It would be a huge mistake to follow O\u2019Hanlon and Shapiro\u2019s recommendation that NATO refocus on missions outside Europe when the biggest danger the alliance faces today is Russia. Indeed, Putin\u2019s Russia is a grave threat to its immediate neighbors, to the West and to global stability more broadly.  In their proposed deal, O\u2019Hanlon and Shapiro demand plenty from the West. What would be asked of Putin? He would be required to retreat from eastern Ukraine and pledge to uphold Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity. But Putin lied about the invasion of Crimea this year, continues to deny that Russian forces are in eastern Ukraine and broke his promises to abide by the Sept. 5 cease-fire. Why should his agreement on a new deal mean anything? After the terrible toll Russia has inflicted on its neighbor \u2014 including the loss of thousands of lives \u2014 it would be unconscionable to give Putin effective veto power over Ukrainian and Western decision-making. The right way to deal with such a threat is by ramping up sanctions, supporting Russia\u2019s neighbors and providing the military assistance Ukraine needs to defend itself. We must contain Putin, not compromise with him or pursue naive \u201cwin-win\u201d approaches that would only weaken our security and that of our friends and allies.

The discussions converged on an approach that resists President Vladimir Putin\u2019s push in Ukraine while continuing to engage Russia economically and politically. \u201cDon\u2019t give in to Putin, but don\u2019t give up on Russia\u201d is how one participant summed up the group\u2019s conclusion.  \u201cHow can we deter Putin from further aggression in Ukraine and drive up the costs to him while, at the same time, keep[ing] the lines open to him on nuclear security, proliferation and Iran?\u201d That\u2019s how Nick Burns, a Harvard professor and the group\u2019s director, summed up the discussion in a message after the conference.        1 of 8       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                       Skip Ad   \u00d7           The low points of the Putin years      View Photos   When Vladi\u00admir Putin came to office in 2000, the former KGB man promised to bring about change in Russia.

The balance of Republicans and Democrats was roughly equal, and the conclusions were somewhat more hawkish than Obama administration policy. But, like the White House, the group agreed on the need for engagement and \u201coff ramps\u201d that open a path for Russia to accept a sovereign but nonhostile Ukraine.  The plan to send humanitarian aid, administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross, in Russian convoys across the border into eastern Ukraine was just taking shape as we met, with some arguing that this was a face-saving exit for Putin and others countering that it was a cover for Russian invasion.  One continuing theme was the fundamental weakness of Russia, despite Putin\u2019s cocky attempt at \u201credux\u201d that seeks to reassert Soviet-era prerogatives. One presenter described Russia\u2019s demographic disaster: a shrinking population; a chronic health crisis that puts Russia between Tanzania and Angola in male life expectancy; a dearth of entrepreneurship, so that the nation ranks below Alabama in patents awarded over the past 10 years.  Given these devastating numbers, noted a panelist, it\u2019s clear that Russia is in decline. The question is whether Russia will experience a sudden decline or a gradual one. The consensus was that U.S. interests wouldn\u2019t be served by fast decline and the resulting instability.  At the beginning of the retreat, there was sharp criticism of \u201cPutinism\u201d and its arrogant assertion of Russian power. Some argued that Putin was \u201cdelusional\u201d in thinking he could restore the prerogatives of the Soviet Union. But others cautioned that Putin\u2019s actions were a predictable reaction to Russia\u2019s humiliation after the crack up of the U.S.S.R. \u2014 and that the United States (unlike the impulsive Putin) should play what one former Cabinet official called \u201cthe long game.\u201d  Putin had made three big mistakes in Ukraine, noted one commentator. He thought the battle for eastern Ukraine would be a walkover for his covert proxy forces, as Crimea was; he thought the pro-Russian separatists could be controlled; and he thought the newly elected government of President Petro Poro\u00adshenko would be weak and short-lived.  As the Aspen discussions progressed, participants focused increasingly on positive steps the United States could take to complement the negative pressure of sanctions. Helping Poroshenko\u2019s Ukraine to become a stronger, less-corrupt nation was a priority, and one participant suggested that the United States lead an international reconstruction program for the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.  Helping Ukraine resist a Russian invasion was a consensus point. There was agreement that a direct U.S. or European military intervention was unlikely, but many participants argued that it would be wise to send lethal-weapons assistance to Ukraine. Several also noted that the United States should quietly advise Ukraine on ways to make an invasion costly for Russia.  Through the four days of discussion, there was a tension between the \u201csqueezers\u201d and the \u201cdealers,\u201d as one participant characterized the meeting\u2019s hawks and doves. But interestingly, the split didn\u2019t fit party lines. In the freewheeling discussion, Democrats sometimes argued a tougher line than Republicans.  The Aspen group was celebrating its 30th anniversary, under the chairmanship of Harvard professor Joseph Nye and former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft.

(Robert Orttung)  The following is a guest post by\u00a0Sean R. Roberts and Robert Orttung of\u00a0George Washington University. ***** A \u201cWar of Lapels\u201d is raging as many people in the post-Soviet space must make political choices about what to wear on their jackets on May 9 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. How citizens accessorize broadcasts their position on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In many ways, Vladimir Putin has framed Russia\u2019s conflict with Ukraine over the past year around a particular historical narrative of World War II that promotes a m\u00e9lange of Soviet greatness with Russian nationalism, while branding Ukrainians as fascists. The Kremlin storyline of World War II is in stark contrast to the narrative honored by most living in Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe, where remembering the war is not related to present-day political disputes but honors the sacrifices of family members alive at that time. This transformation of the Soviet narrative of the war into a Russian nationalist one has been particularly apparent in Russian-Ukrainian relations. In response to Ukraine\u2019s rehabilitation of Stepan Bandera, for example, Russia publicly condemned the Ukrainian government and frequently characterized western Ukrainians as fascists on Russian television. In addition, Moscow sought to convince Russian-speaking Ukrainians and the citizens of other post-Soviet states of the dangers of a growing anti-Russian Ukrainian fascism. In the run-up to the May 9 holiday this year, Moscow is promoting its connections between World War II and the war in eastern Ukraine through an unlikely strategy \u2013 by trying to monopolize the lapels of post-Soviet citizens. This situation has its origins in an ingenious, participatory, and continually evolving Russian nationalist propaganda campaign originally created by Putin\u2019s administration in 2005 as part of the 60th\u00a0anniversary of Victory Day \u2013 the wearing of the Ribbon of St. George or the Georgievskaya Lenta. Since 2005, the Georgievskaya Lenta, an orange-and-black-striped ribbon associated with an 18th\u00a0century czarist Russian military medal, has become an increasingly important part of celebrating the end of World War II in Russia, and it has also been exported by Russia to other post-Soviet states as an overtly Russian symbol of these states\u2019 shared history in the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany. [How the Soviet Union saved the world from Hitler]    People hold a 278-foot-long St. George\u2019s Ribbon, after climbing up onto Mount Beshtau, near Zheleznovodsk in Stavropol region of Russia, on May 3. (Eduard Korniyenko/Reuters)  While this ribbon has generated controversy in the non-Russian post-Soviet states since its introduction in 2005, over the past two years the ribbon has taken on more overtly Russian nationalist meaning in the context of the Russian-Ukraine war. As a result, the ribbon no longer only represents a remembrance of those from throughout the Soviet Union who gave their lives to defeat Nazi Germany; it also represents a symbol of Russia\u2019s historical and present role in preventing the spread of what it calls fascism, which includes its efforts to undermine Ukraine\u2019s present government. In this sense, the wearing of the Georgievskaya Lenta now also expresses explicit support of Putin\u2019s nationalist agenda in Russia and opposition to Ukraine\u2019s new government and its reform efforts. As one might expect, it is very unlikely that Ukrainians outside those areas controlled by the Russian-backed rebels will wear the Georgievskaya Lenta this year on May 9. In the context of the war, Ukrainians are becoming only more united in their patriotism and opposition to Russia. Furthermore, the Ukrainian government has decided to adopt a different decoration to celebrate the defeat of Nazism this year \u2013 a poppy flower, mimicking that worn throughout the British Commonwealth nations and in the United States.    Screen shot of Ukrainian TV showing the usage of a poppy to commemorate World War II.  This symbolic \u201cwar of lapels\u201d has spread throughout the post-Soviet space and threatens to divide the populations of many former Soviet states at a time when they would otherwise be celebrating peace and the sacrifices of their loved ones who had suffered so much during World War II. In Moldova, the Liberal party has taken a strong stance against the Russian World War II narrative, seeking to outlaw the Georgievskaya Lenta as a foreign military symbol. In an attempt to avoid appearing to either support or condemn the Russian narrative, Kyrgyzstan has quietly created their own version of the Russian ribbon by replacing its colors with those of the Kyrgyz flag (red and yellow). In Kazakhstan, which is one of Russia\u2019s closest allies, but also has a large, often restless ethnic Russian minority and is desperately trying not to take sides in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the state has also created its own Kazakh ribbon based on its national flag adorned with Soviet medals. So as not to appear to be countering Russia\u2019s distribution of the Georgievskaya Lenta in Kazakhstan, the state has been careful to point out that citizens can wear any lapel decoration they choose. Although this strategy is in line with Kazakhstan\u2019s usual \u201cmulti-vector\u201d foreign policy, it is also inviting tension in the country as groups of citizens are beginning to mobilize both for and against the Georgievskaya Lenta. At a time when many former Soviet citizens wish to honor a generation who gave so much to stop Nazi aggression 70 years ago, this war of symbols is only polluting popular memory and manipulating it to promote current political purposes. Putin\u2019s strategy of using WWII-era victories to support his own aggression in eastern Ukraine will likely backfire over the long run, at least among those former Soviet citizens living outside Russia. In particular, it likely will create new divisions and conflicts within those post-Soviet states seeking to remain neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.", "articleBiased": true, "articleHeader": "How to understand the post-Soviet \u2018war of lapels\u2019"}, {"articleUrl": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/ex-georgian-president-trying-to-save-ukraine-from-russias-orbit/2015/08/08/7507f3e0-3ab0-11e5-b759-e3c43f009486_story.html", "articleSrc": "WP", "articleText": "  ODESSA, Ukraine \u2014 In Ukraine\u2019s last-ditch battle to stamp out official thievery and wrest the nation from Russia\u2019s orbit, an unlikely leader is heading the charge. Mikheil Saakashvili, the crusading ex-president of Georgia, is trying to upend Ukraine\u2019s most lawless region as the new governor of the smuggling stronghold of Odessa. A man who led his tiny nation into war with mighty Russia has taken up a new fight in a high-profile appointment in a fellow post-Soviet state that was a slap at the Kremlin. Western officials say that Saakashvili\u2019s anti-corruption assault will be as crucial in the effort to break Ukraine free from its ex-Soviet masters as the country\u2019s shooting war with Russian-backed rebels \u2014 and that the hot-headed Georgian has just months to get it done. Public disillusionment with Ukraine\u2019s new leaders is building amid a rising sense that last year\u2019s wave of protests delivered little but fresh misery. Citizens say they still face demands for bribes nearly every time they encounter a government official. Many fear that Ukraine\u2019s leaders will fail altogether and that the country will fall back into Russia\u2019s sphere. \u201cUkraine is a big revolution, and in my way I am a revolutionary,\u201d Saakashvili said in an interview in his office, which is decorated with a bust of Ronald Reagan, the man often credited in Eastern Europe with taking down the Soviet Union. With old habits holding firm, many of Ukraine\u2019s international partners, including the United States, are reconsidering the amount of assistance they can provide if the nation cannot help itself.   New police trainees practice handcuffing techniques at an American-sponsored program to introduce Western-style police to Odessa\u2019s streets in Ukraine on Aug. 5. (John Wendle/for The Washington Post)  That gives an outsize importance to Saakashvili\u2019s effort, which Western diplomats say they are treating as a test case for whether reforms can take hold. Saakashvili has given himself until the end of the year to overhaul Odessa, said a Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on internal discussions. If Saakashvili fails, the diplomat said, \u201cthe window closes for 10 years\u201d on domestic support for Ukrainian reforms. The Obama administration sees the Odessa efforts as so vital that it has committed up to $2\u00a0million in direct assistance and has sent numerous top State Department officials to visit Saakashvili. U.S. money is going to foundations that hire top Saakashvili associates to implement changes. U.S.-paid lawyers are studying the structure of the crime-ridden port. Officers from the California Highway Patrol are training new police officers to replace the detested old ones. \u201cUkraine today is fighting two wars. One is the war with Russia,\u201d the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey R. Pyatt, said last month. \u201cThe other is the war against corruption, the war for reform, the war to move Ukraine towards the standards of modern European democracy that the Ukrainian people have sought.\u201d The region of Odessa \u201cin many ways is the front line for that second war,\u201d Pyatt said. Crusade against corruption Saakashvili, a brash Columbia University-trained lawyer, rose to power in Georgia in 2003 and shook his Caucasian nation out of a post-Soviet stupor with a crusade against corruption that rocketed the country to the top of international ratings for transparency. His ravenous appetite for politicking is Clintonian. But after he launched into war with Russia in 2008, his country suffered a catastrophic defeat within days. Critics say he became increasingly intolerant of dissent. He lost power in 2013 and fled the country to avoid charges of abuses of power that he says are politically motivated. Saakashvili swooped into Odessa at the end of May, taking over a Russian-speaking region of 2.4\u00a0million residents whose alliances are split between Kiev and Moscow. The surprise appointment provoked feverish warnings that he was there to stoke hatred of ethnic Russians, although he has tamped down his old fiery anti-Kremlin rhetoric and has won grudging support from members of the ethnic Russian community who detest corruption as much as ethnic Ukrainians. If Saakashvili fails, Ukraine could soon boomerang back into Russia\u2019s orbit \u2014 with gloomy consequences for Georgia, which is feeling the same competing tugs.

(John Wendle/for The Washington Post)  \u201cBefore if you were involved in governance, you were involved in corruption. It\u2019s very difficult to be dry when you\u2019re in the sea,\u201d Saakashvili told a crowd this past week in Kominternivske, riling them in staccato but fluent Russian. Many in the town of 7,000 said that such a high-ranking official had never bothered to listen to their concerns before, much less travel there by marshrutka, the shuddering, packed minibuses that are the main public transit in rural Ukraine. At the sweltering open-air conclave, held in a dusty square under whispering plane trees, Saakashvili listened while dozens of residents detailed their daily struggles with public officials who sounded more like marauding bandits than civil servants. He quickly won over the crowd with his enthusiastic denunciations of their detested officials. The event was unusual in Ukraine, where politicians typically steer clear of such unvarnished back-and-forth with constituents. \u201cTo get a child in kindergarten, you have to pay a bribe. If someone dies, you have to pay even more,\u201d Saakashvili told them, describing the corruption that has driven Ukrainians to twice overthrow their leaders since 2004. One farmer\u2019s fields were stolen through a feat of paperwork. A mother had to pay bribes for a day-care spot for her son. A soldier on crutches watched his disability benefits drop into the pockets of the officials charged with passing them on to him. \u201cI thought we had some mistakes in the system and we could fix the mistakes, and we\u2019d be okay. It turns out the whole system is a mistake,\u201d said Yulia Marushevska, 25, a Saakashvili deputy and a political novice who rocketed to international attention for her dramatic video dispatches last year from the Maidan, the central Kiev square that was the focal point of pro-European protests. Following the playbook Many of Saakashvili\u2019s recruits are similarly young, Western-educated activists who have no previous political experience. He says he has no idea what the more than 800\u00a0employees of his regional administration do, and he has vowed to fire half of them, along with most of Odessa\u2019s hated police force, which he says is \u201cbasically a criminal syndicate.\u201d And he has promised to clean up the crime-ridden ports of the city of Odessa, a hub for smuggling, drug trafficking and bribery. He has taken on some broadly popular issues. He took a bulldozer to knock down an illegally constructed wall that blocked off a portion of a public beach at a property owned by a former lawmaker. On national television, he chewed out the head of Ukraine\u2019s national airline, who was quickly fired amid charges of corruption. He has vowed a new police force by next month. But critics say that although Saakashvili has made grand promises, he has so far done more to change the tone than the substance of the system. Some question whether he will stay long enough to make sure that his reforms actually stick. Others say that his team is too inexperienced to take on Odessa\u2019s formidable entrenched groups. And he can do little to boost the miserly pay that leads government bureaucrats making $80 a month to seek bribes just to survive. \u201cHe wants to build dreams, but he doesn\u2019t have the instruments,\u201d said Irina Medushevskaya, an Odessan political commentator. At an Odessa police training academy one morning recently, 200 new police recruits were practicing handcuffing each other under the watchful eye of two trainers who had been flown in from the California Highway Patrol, one more marker of U.S. involvement in the region. A total of 400 new trainees, none of whom have law enforcement experience, will hit the streets next month after just seven weeks of practice. The efforts, led from Kiev by a Georgian who was once a top official in Saakashvili\u2019s presidential administration, mirror those of the first years of his rule there. Many recruits said they are motivated by a desire to build clean new institutions. But a Ukrainian trainer said low salaries could lead to problems. \u201cYou should pay enough so that a person doesn\u2019t think about how to feed their families,\u201d Stepan Kostev said. For now, Saakashvili says he will keep following the Georgian playbook to reform his new country. \u201cThere\u2019s a general perception that you cannot transplant politicians. They get rejected by national organisms, like a heart or a liver,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we have matching DNAs.\u201d  Natalie Gryvnyak contributed to this report.

(Efrem Lukatsky/Associated Press)  On Aug. 9, 2015, a senior Russian general declared that if the Ukrainian military crosses Russia\u2019s red line and attempts to recapture the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, Russia would respond with overwhelming force. This statement reaffirms the Kremlin\u2019s official line that Russia needs to hold onto territory it has virtually annexed in Donbas to ensure the viability of its puppet republics, Donetsk and Luhansk. But is it true? Here\u2019s another theory. It could be that President Vladimir Putin regards the takeover of Donbas territories as temporary, and is evaluating this occupation with a strict cost-benefit analysis. Right now, he has concluded that small military victories in the Donbas generate more than enough political capital in Russia to offset the Russian public\u2019s disdain for the hardships of sanctions-induced austerity. [Hey, Putin, have you seen how much China is investing in Ukraine?] Should that assessment change, Putin is very likely to tactically withdraw from Donbas on his own terms. Putin will not regard this withdrawal as a defeat, as Russia will retain a military force in Crimea that could be used to destabilize Ukraine if it tries to join NATO. Three factors suggest that Putin\u2019s commitment to retaining control over the territories is weaker than his regime\u2019s rhetoric indicates:  Russia\u2019s military presence in and occupation of Donbas territory is much less popular among Russian-speaking Ukrainians than Putin initially predicted in 2014.   The Ukrainian government has more power than it has used in the conflict thus far, and it could use this influence to force Putin to back down sooner than expected in Donbas.   There is compelling evidence that Putin\u2019s long-term goal is to create a \u201cfrozen conflict\u201d in Donbas, a scenario in which active fighting is suspended but ethnic tensions remain and can reignite at any time.  In addition, withdrawal from territories in Donbas would relieve Russia of the costs of occupation. Let\u2019s examine these factors in turn. 1. The Donbas Russian speakers don\u2019t like the occupation Russia would have a difficult time controlling the Donbas in the long-term because its imperialism is unpopular there. Putin did not expect mass resistance from Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine, but that\u2019s what he has gotten. Prominent Ukrainian analysts such as International Democracy Institute Director Sergiy Taran argue that Putin extended his military campaign from Crimea to Donbas because he thought Russian speakers would greet him as a liberator. [Yes, Ukraine is still in crisis. Would becoming a \u2018buffer state\u2019 help?] By contrast, Western analysts knew that Russian incursions into Donbas would be unpopular, given trends documented in public opinion polls. Oxford political scientists Paul Chaisty and Stephen Whitefield argued in 2014 that as few as 4 to 6 percent of people in Donetsk and Luhansk supported outright separatism. A May 2014 opinion poll showed that only 19 percent of Kharkiv\u2019s citizens supported the Russian occupation. The same poll showed that in Odessa, a Russian-majority city, Putin registered only 14 percent support. Former Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili, a staunch enemy of the Kremlin, is now a highly popular governor in Odessa. That opposition is why Putin\u2019s military foray into eastern Ukraine shocked most observers. 2. Whether Russia\u2019s military operations can keep the Donbas territories is beyond Putin\u2019s control Few analysts seem to recognize the Ukrainian government\u2019s important role and latent power in shaping events. The leverage that the Ukrainian government has in abeyance could cause Putin to opt for withdrawal rather than risk a potentially disastrous military escalation. [Why the U.S. does nothing in Ukraine] Consider the fact that Russian forces swiftly occupied some regions of eastern Ukraine but did not emerge victorious in others. For example, Russian forces were able to easily take over parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, but failed to triumph in other cities with large ethnic Russian populations, like Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv. Russia\u2019s early successes were attributable in part to poor coordination between the Ukrainian government and regional oligarchs who profoundly impact military operations on the ground. Lucan Way, a University of Toronto professor and expert in post-Soviet regimes, agreed with this theory, in a recent interview with me. He believes that Russia\u2019s initial successes were partially attributable to miscommunications between the Ukrainian government and eastern Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. Way argued that if the Ukrainian government had been more willing to make a deal with Akhmetov, Russian aggression could have been thwarted earlier. If the Ukrainian government can learn from this experience and coordinate more closely with regional oligarchs, it will be able to confront Russian aggression from a position of greater strength. There are other ways the Ukrainian government can still influence events. For instance, the Ukrainian state could strengthen itself economically through tighter relationships with the European Union and China. Should this work, Ukraine\u2019s decreased dependency on trade with Russia, and increased capital for arms production, would greatly increase its military power relative to pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas. Ukraine could also deter further Russian aggression by increasing the costs of Russian military involvement. If the Ukrainian government can coordinate with its oligarchs to escalate counterterrorism efforts against pro-Russian separatist militias, and procure lethal arms or technical support from its Western allies, more Russian soldiers would perish in Donbas. That would make a tactical withdrawal a more cost-effective, politically justifiable strategy for Putin. 3. Putin wants a frozen conflict. It costs less and threatens more. \u00a0 Since the Soviet Union dissolved, Russia has had one especially common pattern in its military interventions in the Commonwealth of Independent States, the region directly around its southern seas: frozen conflict, which would work well in Ukraine. [Russians see Ukraine as an illegitimate state] To see how this approach works, let\u2019s look at what happened in Transnistria, a small strip of land on the Moldova-Ukraine border. In accordance with the cease-fire agreement ending the 1992 war between Moldova and Transnistria, Russia stationed 2,000 troops in Transnistria. These troops prevented the autonomous region from rejoining either Moldova or Russia. Moldova denounced this Russian military presence as a violation of international law because it infringes on Moldovan sovereignty. Russia has resisted international pressure to withdraw its military force because its presence deters Moldova from applying for NATO membership. Frozen conflicts are typically created as a result of settlements in countries beset with deep-seated ethnic tensions. Before 2014, Ukraine\u2019s ethnic tensions were not high enough to threaten civil war. In fact, substantial evidence suggests that Russia manufactured ethnic tensions before its military intervention to prepare for a frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine. Oxford University Professor Roy Allison in his 2013 book \u201cRussia, the West and Military Intervention\u201d describes how the Kremlin alarmed the Ukrainian government by distributing Russian passports to Crimean citizens during the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia. Then Putin was able to use the pretext of protecting Russian civilians to justify moving Russian forces into Crimea and Donbas. The passports prove that Russia had long planned to set up a frozen conflict here as well. While the methods used in Russia\u2019s interventions in Moldova and Ukraine differ, Russia will likely emulate the Moldovan frozen conflict strategy in Ukraine, due to deep ethnic tensions in both states and Russia\u2019s common objective of keeping both countries in its sphere of influence. Russia will therefore keep troops on the Ukraine border should it tactically withdraw from the Donbas territories. The implicit threat would be the same as in Moldova: enter NATO and risk war. The threat would be backed by Russia\u2019s permanent hold on the Black Sea naval base of Sevastopol. Meanwhile, if Russia were to end its occupation and create a frozen conflict, it could save some rubles. Consider that it will eventually need to subsidize pensions in eastern Ukraine, which by late 2014 were $2.6 billion in arrears. Indirect imperialism would be much more cost-effective. Some analysts of Russian conduct are succumbing to new Cold War hysteria when they assume that Donbas is being incorporated into a new Russian empire. That view is contradicted by realities on the ground and by Russia\u2019s past conduct after military interventions. Russia\u2019s real objective is to influence Ukraine\u2019s foreign policy. It can do that best without further territorial expansion.

His book \u201cImperial Gamble: Putin, Ukraine and the New Cold War\u201d will be published this month.   The war in Ukraine has slipped off the front pages. Eighteen months ago, when Russian President Vladimir Putin seized Crimea and then instigated a pro-Russian rebellion in the Donbas region, Ukraine was hot news. Putin was roundly denounced, and Russia was hit with damaging economic sanctions. East-West relations soured badly, and diplomats wondered whether they were witnessing the beginnings of another cold war. Now Ukraine, as a European crisis, has lost its urgency. One reason is the rush of other news, from global economic jitters and the flood of desperate Arab and African migrants to Europe to the preoccupying nuttiness of the U.S. presidential campaign. But there is another equally important reason. Putin seems to have won his little war in Ukraine, and his Western critics watch from the sidelines, sputtering with helpless rage. Roughly a year ago, Putin faced one of the biggest decisions of his presidency: whether to strike a compromise deal with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko or openly commit his troops and tanks to the war. Much to the surprise of many observers, the Ukrainian army and militias seemed a battle away from defeating Putin\u2019s rebels. Putin, facing defeat, doubled-down and ordered his forces to cross the border and turn back the Ukrainian advance. He clearly wanted to prove to Poroshenko and his Western backers that in a war between Russia and Ukraine, Russia would win.  Within a few weeks, Putin and Poroshenko reached agreement on a rickety cease-fire, which predictably did not hold. Early this year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel rushed to negotiate another cease-fire, but she knew, as did President Obama, that it depended in large part on whether Poroshenko and his Kiev colleagues would extend recognition (a form of legitimacy) to rebel leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk and grant them autonomous status within Ukraine. This was and remains a bitter pill for Poroshenko to swallow. He faces violent opposition from right-wing extremists, and he runs a fragile country in serious economic and political trouble. More important, perhaps, he knows by now that neither Germany nor the United States will fight for Ukraine. Yes, they will offer warm words of support, modest financial and military assistance, of course \u2014 but apparently little more.  In this environment of caution and retreat, Putin has, slowly but surely, \u201cfrozen\u201d the conflict, much as he did in 2008 in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. Far more than Western leaders, Putin can now influence and, when necessary, control the flow of economic, political and diplomatic developments in Ukraine.  For this \u201cvictory,\u201d Putin has had to pay a heavy price. His economy has floundered, his reputation has suffered and Russia has experienced a return to domestic disorder and discontent that is real, even spreading. But as yet this has not had any discernible effect on his position within Russia. He seems perfectly capable of retaining his almost dictatorial grip on political power. I sometimes dream an impossible dream \u2014 that somehow we could magically transport Ukraine into Western Europe, where it would prosper as a Western democracy with a vibrant economy. It deserves such a future. But we cannot. Ukraine will always share a common border with Russia in much the same way that it shares a common culture, language and religion with Russia. For most of its existence, Ukraine has been a part of Russia, separating itself as an independent nation only in 1991, when the Soviet Union disintegrated. Ukraine lives uncomfortably in Russia\u2019s \u201cnear abroad,\u201d its backyard, its \u201csphere of influence.\u201d Whether we like it or not, Russia is the dominant power in Eastern Europe, and no solution to the current crisis can realistically emerge unless and until Russia and Ukraine work out an acceptable modus vivendi between them. Putin\u2019s attitude toward Ukraine is similar to that of other Russian leaders. He is not breaking new ground. His definition of nirvana is a Slavic confederation consisting of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine \u2014 all, as he puts it, \u201chistorically Russian land.\u201d Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, he labels \u201cthe mother of all Russian cities,\u201d and he speaks of the \u201caspiration of the Russians, of historical Russia .\u2009.\u2009. of ancient Rus,\u201d as Russia and Ukraine bound together by a common history of more than a thousand years.  Putin can tolerate an independent Ukraine so long as it is \u201cfriendly\u201d to Russian national interests, and, as any good despot, he trusts only himself to define this friendship. Down the road, he has hinted that he would like to convene a Yalta-type conference, at which he and other world leaders would redraw the map of post-1991 Europe. It\u2019s not a very likely possibility, but Putin thinks he has time. He has Ukraine squirming in the palm of his hand, and he sees his Western adversaries as weak, divided, corrupt and, maybe, in this circumstance, ready to strike a deal to his liking.

(Efrem Lukatsky/AP)  There are\u00a0multiple accounts\u00a0suggesting that\u00a0there was actually a productive meeting among the foreign ministers of Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine earlier this week over the conflict in eastern Ukraine.\u00a0According to the BBC: [German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter]\u00a0Steinmeier said all parties reaffirmed that the ceasefire, which has held for almost two weeks, needed to be consolidated. The warring sides were now \u201cvery close\u201d to a deal that would see the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the frontline, he added. He also said there was some progress on the legal groundwork towards holding local elections in eastern Ukraine in October. If the conflict in Ukraine has stabilized while, at the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin has deployed more military force to Syria, what does it mean? Shockingly, commentators are split on this question. \u00a0My colleague Jackson Diehl thinks it\u2019s a sign that Putin is winning: Some analysts claim that a floundering Putin is meddling in the Middle East out of desperation because his bid for Ukraine has failed. But another way to see it is this: Putin\u2019s use of force succeeded in inducing the West to accept his Ukraine demands \u2014 and he is trying to repeat his triumph in a second theater\u2026. Well, that\u2019s possible, but as Diehl\u2019s embedded links suggest, there\u2019s another way of interpreting the emerging cease-fire. For example, the German Marshall Fund\u2019s Ulrich Speck writes: Russia will not announce defeat in Ukraine. But Ukraine\u2019s resistance against the Russian-led attack in Donbas in combination with support from the West has made it impossible for Moscow to win back control over Ukraine any time soon without a major war. Instead of falling back into Russia\u2019s sphere of domination, Ukraine has started along the long and hard road toward building a liberal-democratic nation state\u2026. [N]either Ukraine nor the West is ready to accept Russia\u2019s interpretation of Minsk II. Instead of becoming a tool to control Ukraine, the Donbas region is becoming another \u201cfrozen conflict,\u201d a Russian-controlled enclave, similar to Transnistria. Under economic stress because of the fall of oil prices and Western sanctions, and without substantial support from other important players (such as China), the Kremlin seems to be ready to give up on the goal of reintegrating Ukraine, at least for the moment. So it would be safe to say that there are differing interpretations of what\u2019s happening in Ukraine. And these interpretations matter greatly. If you agree with Diehl, then a robust response in Syria is absolutely necessary, because Putin now thinks that he can do whatever he wants with his military without fear of retaliation. If you agree with Speck and others, then Putin\u2019s Syria gambit looks like a much more desperate gamble. So who lost Ukraine? The answer depends crucially on your starting point. \u00a0If you ask who lost Ukraine compared to the status quo in, say, February 2014 after Viktor Yanukovych fled the scene, then you\u2019d have to answer the West. Ukraine has gone from being a triumphal story of social movements translating into a pro-Western government in Kiev to a country dismembered by Russia. Moscow now controls the Crimea and will not be returning it. Russian forces and Russian proxies control a slice of eastern Ukraine, and that conflict looks like it\u2019s frozen \u2014 and that\u2019s the best-case outcome for the Ukrainian government. In essence, Vladimir Putin has been able to violate Westphalian sovereignty with impunity on the European continent, and has more territory as a result. Putin retains the option of\u00a0heating up the frozen conflict whenever he wants. There is no way to paint this as a victory for the West or Western norms.    Russian President Vladimir Putin took a dive in a submersible off Crimea's coast, annexed by Moscow last year. (Reuters)   On the other hand, if you ask who lost Ukraine compared to the status quo in, say, September\u00a02013, then you\u2019d have to answer Russia. It\u2019s worth stressing that at that point, Russia had a perfectly pliant ally governing\u00a0its most strategically vital neighbor. Moscow was about to pull off a feat of economic statecraft in forcing Ukraine to abandon the European Union\u2019s Eastern Partnership program. Ukraine looked set to join Putin\u2019s Eurasian Economic Union. And\u00a0now, after a significant loss of Russian blood and treasure, Moscow can claim \u2026 control over the least economically viable portions of Ukraine. No matter how much Russia ratchets up the violence, it will not\u00a0be able to peaceably hold much more Ukrainian territory. I wrote the following in July: The hard truth remains that Putin\u2019s strategic position now is weaker than it was five years ago. Now he has to deal with a weaker domestic economy, a hostile Ukrainian government that will create more Russian casualties, and a NATO that\u2019s gearing up to more credibly defend\u00a0Eastern Europe. Putin has responded in numerous ways, none of them terribly effective. Sure, he\u2019s embraced the east \u2014 but China will be happy to exploit this opportunity for commercial gains and\u00a0not much else. And for all the talk about Russia\u2019s efforts to propagandize its way into the hearts and minds of some European populations, the fact remains that European leaders are likely to be more resolute in an escalating crisis, and\u00a0the European Union is still way more powerful on the continent than Russia. The only way in which Putin\u2019s strategy has worked is in bolstering his own domestic standing. Nothing has changed in Putin\u2019s favor in the months since. Wait, actually, that\u2019s not true, because the price of Russia\u2019s primary exports has fallen further, and it looks like China is going to screw Russia over even more on the gas deals. So who lost Ukraine? On the one hand, congratulations, you\u2019re all losers, especially the Ukrainians!! But from a truly realpolitik perspective, however, Russia is the biggest loser. This fact is worth keeping in mind when everyone starts freaking out about Russia\u2019s military presence in Syria. This is not to say that such a presence is a good thing for anyone. It\u2019s not. Rather, it would be a mistake to infer that Russia\u2019s use of military statecraft amounts to a permanent expansion of Russian influence. As with Ukraine, Russia\u2019s strategic position in the Middle East was stronger five years ago than it is today. \u00a0Or, to sum it up in a tweet:   Russia has a history of overextending itself into catastrophic consequences. Wait for it. https://t.co/hbYQZm06W4 \u2014 Brett Friedman (@BA_Friedman) September 14, 2015 ", "articleBiased": true, "articleHeader": "Who lost Ukraine?"}, {"articleUrl": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/putins-gambit-obamas-puzzlement/2015/09/17/8d168584-5d6d-11e5-9757-e49273f05f65_story.html", "articleSrc": "WP", "articleText": " Once again, President Obama and his foreign policy team are stumped. Why is Vladimir Putin pouring troops and weaponry into Syria? After all, as Secretary of State John Kerry has thrice told his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, it is only making things worse. But worse for whom? For the additional thousands of civilians who will die or flee as a result of the inevitably intensified fighting. True, and I\u2019m sure Lavrov is as moved by their plight as by the 8,000 killed in Russia\u2019s splendid little Ukrainian adventure.  Charles Krauthammer writes a weekly political column that runs on Fridays. View Archive   Facebook RSS   Kerry and Obama are serially surprised because they cannot fathom the hard men in the Kremlin. Yet Putin\u2019s objectives in Syria are blindingly obvious: 1. To assert Russia\u2019s influence in the Middle East and make it the dominant outside power. Putin\u2019s highest ambition is to avenge and reverse Russia\u2019s humiliating loss of superpower status a quarter-century ago. Understanding this does not come easily to an American president who for seven years has been assiduously curating America\u2019s decline abroad. 2. To sustain Russia\u2019s major and long-standing Arab ally. Ever since Anwar Sadat kicked the Soviets out of Egypt in 1972, Syria\u2019s Assads have been Russia\u2019s principal asset in the Middle East. 3. To expand the reach of Russia\u2019s own military. It has a naval base at Tartus, its only such outside of Russia. It has an airfield near Latakia, now being expanded with an infusion of battle tanks, armored personnel carriers, howitzers and housing for 1,500 \u2014 strongly suggesting ground forces to follow. 4. To push out the Americans. For Putin, geopolitics is a zero-sum game: Russia up, America down. He is demonstrating whom you can rely on in this very tough neighborhood. Obama has given short shrift to the Kurds, shafted U.S. allies with the Iran deal and abandoned the Anbar Sunnis who helped us win the surge. Meanwhile, Putin risks putting Russian boots on the ground to rescue his Syrian allies. Obama says Bashar al-Assad has to go, draws a red line on chemical weapons \u2014 and does nothing. Russia acts on behalf of a desperate ally. Whom do you want in your corner? 5. To re-legitimize post-Crimea Russia by making it indispensable in Syria. It\u2019s a neat two-cushion shot. At the United Nations next week, Putin will offer Russia as a core member of a new anti-Islamic State coalition. Obama\u2019s Potemkin war \u2014 with its phantom local troops (our $500 million training program has yielded five fighters so far) and flaccid air campaign \u2014 is flailing badly. What Putin is proposing is that Russia, Iran and Hezbollah spearhead the anti-jihadist fight.  Putin\u2019s offer is clear: Stop fighting Assad, accept Russia as a major player and acquiesce to a Russia-Iran-Hezbollah regional hegemony \u2014 and we will lead the drive against the Islamic State from in front. And there is a bonus. The cleverest part of the Putin gambit is its unstated cure for Europe\u2019s refugee crisis. Wracked by guilt and fear, the Europeans have no idea what to do. Putin offers a way out: No war, no refugees. Stop the Syrian civil war and not only do they stop flooding into Europe, those already there go back home to Syria.  Putin says, settle the war with my client in place \u2014 the Assad regime joined by a few \u201chealthy\u201d opposition forces \u2014 and I solve your refugee nightmare. You almost have to admire the cynicism. After all, what\u2019s driving the refugees is the war and what\u2019s driving the war is Iran and Russia. They provide the materiel, the funds and now, increasingly, the troops that fuel the fighting. The arsonist plays fireman. After all, most of the refugees are not fleeing the Islamic State. Its depravity is more ostentatious, but it is mostly visited upon minorities, Christian and Yazidi \u2014 and they have already been largely ethnically cleansed from Islamic State territory. The European detention camps are overflowing with Syrians fleeing Assad\u2019s barbarism, especially his attacks on civilians, using artillery, chlorine gas and nail-filled barrel bombs. Putin to the rescue. As with the chemical weapons debacle, he steps in to save the day. If we acquiesce, Russia becomes an indispensable partner. It begins military and diplomatic coordination with us. (We\u2019ve just agreed to negotiations over Russia\u2019s Syrian buildup.) Its post-Ukraine isolation is lifted and, with Iran, it becomes the regional arbiter. In the end, the Putin strategy may not work, but it\u2019s deadly serious and not at all obscure. The White House can stop scratching its collective head whenever another Condor transport unloads its tanks and marines at Latakia.

But that was in Donetsk, Ukraine, in 2014, where Borodai was prime minister of a \u00adpro-Russian separatist government. Now, he is back in his native Moscow and, as he tells it, back to his old day job as a public relations consultant. \u201cWhen you are not on television, people start to forget what you look like,\u201d he said, sinking into a cream-colored sofa in a tony Moscow restaurant for an interview. \u201cAnd thank God for that. It was hard to go out on the street at first.\u201d It is an unlikely, perhaps unbelievable, transformation for the most prominent Russian citizen in the war in Ukraine and the possible target of a Dutch investigation into the missile attack on a Malaysian airliner in July last year that killed 298 people. Borodai is not the only one of Russia\u2019s self-proclaimed volunteer fighters to reappear here. As the conflict in east Ukraine has reached a stalemate, hundreds of volunteers have returned to Russia, and the early rebel leaders, many of them native Russians, have resumed comfortable, increasingly public lives in Moscow.   Wrapped in a tight Armani Exchange T-shirt and sporting a week\u2019s stubble, Borodai said that he has not been in Donetsk since October and that his focus now is on reviving his consulting company. Business is bad. Several international companies, which he declined to name, severed their contracts when he was subjected to sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. Consulting \u201cis an intimate business that requires a personal touch,\u201d Borodai said, which was lacking while he was out of town. \u201cPeople go to war, fulfill their duty, and then go back to peaceful, productive lives,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is especially interesting.\u201d  [Female Ukrainian war hero facing 25 years in Russian jail]  Borodai\u2019s respite from the spotlight may be short-lived, as Russia and the West are on a collision course over the Flight\u00a017 investigation. The West has blamed rebel leaders, of whom Borodai was the most visible, and Russia for supplying them with sophisticated anti-aircraft weapons. Russia denies this, vetoed a United Nations tribunal and criticized the Dutch investigation as opaque. Indictments are expected near the end of the year. \u201cI don\u2019t have an answer. Let\u2019s wait and see,\u201d said Borodai when asked whether he would go to the Netherlands to face trial if accused. \u201cThis is a story that is long in the past for me, and I have done everything that I thought necessary and needed to support a full investigation.\u201d Even if separatist leaders are formally accused, there are few signs Moscow would comply with the investigation or an extradition request. The return home In the meantime, the gang\u2019s all here. You could have bumped into Marat Bashirov, the former prime minister of the separatist Luhansk People\u2019s Republic, at the Moscow Economic Forum in March, where he gave a lecture titled \u201cRisks, sanctions, lobbying.\u201d Bashirov, a Moscow government relations consultant once employed by the oligarch Viktor Vekselberg\u2019s holding company, was subjected to sanctions by the European Union in July 2014 along with Borodai. A snappy dresser, he remarked on a government airstrike on his headquarters in July last year in a dry post on Facebook: \u201cIt seems my Tom Ford suit has been killed. Now I will hold government sessions in camouflage.\u201d Bashirov did not reply to requests for comment. In Moscow, he runs several government relations firms and chairs a committee on government relations at the Russia Managers Association, a spokesman there said. Last month, dressed in a navy blue suit, he gave a presentation to young entrepreneurs, one of whom tweeted: \u201cGovernment is the regulator between producer and consumer. Marat Bashirov.\u201d There is also Igor Girkin, the battle commander who once bragged that if not for his attacks on police stations in April last year, there would be no war in Ukraine. He now appears at lectures with far-right nationalists and has gone spectacularly off message, accusing Russia of abandoning the separatist republics in Ukraine that it helped to create. \u201cThe village crazy,\u201d Borodai said with a smile. Borodai and Girkin are veterans of the ethnic conflicts that emerged with the fall of the Soviet Union. Borodai fought alongside ethnic Russians in Transnistria, Chechnya and \u00adTajikistan during the 1990s. After each conflict, he returned to Moscow. \u201cFor them, this is just another war,\u201d said Alexei Makarkin, a commentator on politics who studied alongside Girkin at a university in Moscow in the 1990s. \u201cIt isn\u2019t something that feels extraordinary; they fought in the \u201990s, after all.\u201d Skeptics, and there are many, say that Borodai is either paid by Russia or is an employee of Russia\u2019s security services. He denies both charges but said he passed information from \u00adDonetsk to Vladislav Surkov, the Kremlin apparatchik said to be overseeing Russian policy on Ukraine. Some events point to Russian control, such as the surprise arrivals of Borodai and Bashirov at a time of political chaos for the separatists. Others suggest miscommunication: When the rebels in May last year held referendums seen as a prelude to annexation, the Kremlin \u00adignored them. It was an awkward moment for both sides.  [Russia holds its first International Army Games]  \u201cI believe he acted carefully and competently,\u201d Borodai said of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s policy in Ukraine. \u201cI can\u2019t criticize his actions because in the end he has far more information than I do.\u201d Russians returning from the war have diverse political views, and a small number are even openly hostile to Putin. Many more say they support Putin but believe he should have supported the volunteers more. \u201cThe government has hindered us more than anything,\u201d said Vladimir Yefimov, a volunteer leader with a flowing beard who led 50 volunteers to war. \u201cBut I can say that because I am from here and \u00adallowed to criticize the government.\u201d Some believe that Russia\u2019s support for volunteers fighting in Ukraine could provoke instability or blowback. There have been worrying incidents: A former separatist sniper will soon stand trial in Moscow for the killing of two police officers last autumn. And the Federal Security Service has built a \u00ad100-kilometer trench on the Ukrainian border because of concerns about weapons smugglers bringing automatic rifles and grenades from Ukraine. But there have not been clear signs yet that returned volunteers pose an urgent threat to Russia as either criminals or politicians. \u201cFirst, there just are not that many of them,\u201d Mark Galeotti, a security expert who visited Moscow this summer, said of returning volunteers. \u201cI think that the Russians should be more concerned about the soldiers who are coming back.\u201d The soldiers are Russian servicemen, some of whom have died under mysterious circumstances and are believed to have been fighting in Ukraine. Putin has shrugged off the accusations. Those who fought openly, calling themselves volunteers, are a more eccentric lot: nationalists or far-leftists, war veterans, thrill seekers and a few would-be philosophers. Sergei Kavtaradze, an aide to Borodai in Donetsk who was once labeled \u201cthe hipster with a machine gun,\u201d returned to Russia last year and is now finishing a film adaptation of his doctoral dissertation.

In a trailer for the film, which Kavtaradze said was produced over the past five years, scenes of combat, torture and sex are cut together in quick succession under a heroic soundtrack. He said that he also filmed \u201ca little bit\u201d in Donetsk, when there was time. \u201cHopefully, it may be in some Western festivals next year,\u201d Kavtaradze said of the film.

He likened the idea of Novorossiya \u2014 the term invoked by Russian nationalists for breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine \u2014 to a realm in the fantasy universe of \"The Lord of the Rings,\" the popular trilogy written by the late J.R.R. Tolkien and eventually made into a Hollywood blockbuster. \"Ukraine existed, exists and will exist. But Novorossiya is the same myth as famous writer Tolkien's Mordor,\" Poroshenko said.  Mordor, for those who don't know, is the fell\u00a0domain of Tolkien's great villain, Sauron. It's shrouded in darkness, guarded by towering black gates and populated by ranks of monstrous orcs and other, even nastier\u00a0creatures. \"It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire, ash, and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume,\" intones one of Tolkien's characters in the film.\u00a0\"There is evil there that does not sleep.\" Poroshenko's reference to Mordor doesn't come out of nowhere. As Bloomberg View's Leonid Bershidsky noted in an article last year, some in Kiev have peddled this image\u00a0of a big, bad Russia resembling Mordor, while conjuring Ukraine as something like the pastoral, innocent Shire, full of well-meaning little Hobbits. The analogy got particular attention last December when a Russian company briefly contemplated installing a holographic \"Eye of Sauron\" \u2014 the fiery, all-seeing orb of the dread lord \u2014 atop a Moscow skyscraper. But Tolkien, the late British author and academic, rejected earlier\u00a0interpretations of his text that connected the evil of the \"East\" with Stalinist Russia.\u00a0\"The situation was conceived long before the Russian revolution. Such allegory is entirely foreign to my thought,\" he wrote in a letter to his publishers in 1961, cited by Bershidsky. \"The placing of Mordor in the east was due to simple narrative and geographical necessity, within my 'mythology.' \" Whatever the case, Russia \u2014 or at least a historical concept related to Russia \u2014 is hardly the only place on this planet that has been linked to Tolkien's Mordor.

The allegory of evil in Tolkien's universe had less to do with geography than a bending and twisting of nature.\u00a0Mordor is all smoke and pollution, bellowing furnaces and blackening land. This was, in part, Tolkien's reaction to industrialization. And its mark could be\u00a0seen especially in areas around the city of Birmingham,\u00a0the home of Tolkien's parents. A recent exhibition in the nearby city of Wolverhampton linked images from Tolkien's sketchbooks to depictions of the Black Country, a region northwest of Birmingham once known for its coal mines, steel mills and stretches of industrial blight.

The \u201cpurifying fire\u201d came as a surprise when the Russian government starting burning food and boasting about it on state television.  A year ago, the government introduced an embargo on food imports from Western countries. This embargo raised domestic food prices and contributed to a major decline in real incomes. But why isn\u2019t it enough to confiscate Western food? Why burn it? For people raised in Soviet and post- Soviet Russia, the destruction of food is a taboo. In the past 100 years, Russia has experienced several famines. Even though there is no famine in modern Russia, more than 20 million people live in poverty. It would certainly make more sense to hand out food to them instead of destroying it. Can food burning be rationalized? Actually, for today\u2019s Russian government, burning imports is a very rational move because it looks so horrible. The Kremlin wants to send a clear message: Yes, we can do things that you find irrational and unthinkable; do not mess with us. It is important to communicate this message inside and outside of Russia. To its supporters within Russia, the government says: The standoff with the West is a matter of principle, whatever the economic cost. (Such a statement is very timely \u2014 Russia\u2019s second-quarter gross domestic product fell by 4.6\u00a0percent over the second quarter of last year.) The Kremlin also sends a signal of self-confidence to the domestic opposition: The government can afford doing unpopular things and still remain in control.  Outside of Russia, this is a signal of commitment to the course of confrontation. The West should understand that it cannot predict the Kremlin\u2019s actions, and Western leaders should be afraid that Russia will do things that they would not dare do themselves. Coming from a nuclear power, this message sounds especially frightening.  But this is not the whole story. Food burning also demonstrates that the embargo\u2019s main goal was not to reciprocate Western sanctions. If the goal were to punish European farmers, the government would confiscate the imports and hand them to the poor \u2014 this would hurt the European exporters as much as burning the food would. Food burning benefits only the Russian agricultural lobby. It reduces the supply of food in Russia, raising domestic prices and domestic producers\u2019 profits. In this sense, food burning is not geopolitics; it is good old protectionism, fair and square. It shows that the government cares more about the agricultural lobby than Russian households. Russia\u2019s anti-trade lobby has always been strong, but the World Trade Organization (WTO) accession in August 2012 has put it in a straitjacket. Initially, the Russian elites did not fully understand the WTO\u2019s power. Allegedly, when selling the WTO accession to leftist members of parliament, a top government official said, \u201cYou should not worry about WTO rules; we will only pretend to stick to them while continuing protectionist policies.\u201d After joining the WTO, the government introduced a \u201ccar recycling duty.\u201d It was supposed to be paid only by foreign car manufacturers \u2014 to protect the domestic automotive sector after WTO accession commitments required a lowering of car import duties. However, Russia soon discovered that the WTO is a rule-based organization with teeth. An obvious violation of rules would result in retaliation \u2014 which other members immediately told Russia. Russia had to return to the equal playing field, and the government imposed the recycling duty on domestic car producers as well. With Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, everything has changed. Having sold the cow, Russia has also sold her milk. Having violated the U.N. Charter when it did so, Russia can afford to break WTO rules. Once sanctions against Russia were introduced, politically connected businesses successfully lobbied for sector-specific and even company-specific subsidies and protectionist regulations \u2014 even if they violate WTO rules. These decisions show that the government\u2019s priority is protecting the incomes of the lobbyists at the expense of Russian taxpayers and pensioners. If there are still any doubts as to whether the government cares more about the corrupt elites or about the ordinary Russians, the \u201cpurifying fire\u201d has burned these doubts into the ground.
