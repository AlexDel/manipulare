[{"articleText": "Israeli news site Ynet News, citing unnamed Western diplomats, reported\u00a0Monday that Russia began \u201cmilitary intervention\u201d in Syria and deployed fighter jets and helicopters to a government airbase near Damascus to launch attacks against ISIS and rebel-aligned targets.The Kremlin has dismissed the allegations, saying \"One shouldn't believe these reports.\"Earlier, a Forbes Magazine report on alleged Russian army casualties in Ukraine citing a dodgy Russian website sparked\u00a0a media and Twitter storm.READ MORE: \u2018What happened to standards of journalism, \u2018trusted\u2019 Western media?\u2019RT:According to the latest article, Russia is \u201csending jets to Syria\u201d to fight ISIL, and moreover, Iran is cooperating with them and the US knows all about it. How do you feel about this story?Richard Spencer: I would first point out that this Ynet story is actually the number one story on Google news when you google Russia and Syria. So this is not some alternative media blog \u2013 this is a major part of the propaganda war. In some ways it comes out of an alternative universe, and it is not coming from universe we live in. Russia, as opposed to the US, has been the power that has really stressed stability, and stressed diplomacy. Russia has prevented a war in Syria in 2013, or at least you could say that it played indispensable role in preventing what would be yet another catastrophic endless conflict in that region. Yes, I think it\u2019s a part of a propaganda war, it is part of a certain faction in the US that wants the Shia and Sunni to be going at it endlessly, that actually wants chaos in the region, that thinks that it is good for Israel, or some other\u2019s interest. The whole point about a propaganda war is of course not that it is true, and it is not even that you can\u2019t debunk it later; the whole point of the propaganda war is to get it out there. So you have things like \u201cweapons of mass destruction,\u201d you have things like \u201cVladimir Putin ordered a plane to be shut down in Ukraine,\u201d and so on, and so on. These things can be disproven; these things turn out to be bogus. But the whole point is to get them out there. They are kind of percolating throughout the media and through people\u2019s minds in the west. And that is mainly what the story was about.\n                    Gorlovka residents near an apartment building on Kirova Street damaged during a night shelling by the Ukrainian military. \u00a9 Iliya Pitalev / RIA Novosti     \n                RT:In many cases, like in the aforementioned story, the alleged evidence proved to be bogus. Why supposedly credible news organizations are not doing fact-checking before publication?RS: Unfortunately, not all news organizations are really concerned about the truth and about getting it right, and about digging in. There are certainly a lot of news organizations that are simply interested in sensation for sensation sake. But also there is quite a bit of organizations that are really connected with governments and connected with specific factors or movements within governments. You can see this with the conservative media in the US \u2013 they have a very specific foreign policy agenda; they are going to report on the \u201cfacts\u201d in a way that supports that agenda. And that agenda, of course, is more war that they think will benefit the US or Israel. But you have to think: the media is very often an arm of governments, an arm of movements within governments. And that is most likely what we\u2019re seeing today with this Ynet story.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.", "articleHeader": "\n\n        Bogus reports as part of Western media war\n\n     \n\n    ", "articleBiased": true, "articleUrl": "http://www.rt.com/op-edge/314151-russia-military-media-hysteria/", "articleSrc": "RT"}, {"articleText": "The new document, unveiled in a Wednesday statement, \u201cemphasizes the need to improve\u201d the professional skills of the country\u2019s army, and warns of the\u00a0\u201chigh probability\u201d of foreign military involvement in its internal conflict.The Ukrainian Defense Council also supported the suggestion of the Cabinet and security officials to expand the list of economic sanctions imposed on Russian \u201clegal bodies and individuals\u201d, TASS news agency reported.READ MORE:\u00a0UK announces doubling of military training for Ukrainian army \u2013 now for 2,000 soldiersAccording to the statement, Russian nationals were \u201cinvolved in financial support of terrorists and other criminal activities, as well as in the violation of the international law, having supported the annexation of the Ukrainian territory by the Russian Federation\u201d.Ukrainian officials referred to Crimea's decision to join Russia after a local referendum showed overwhelming support for the move last March.READ MORE:\u00a0Poroshenko inks permission for foreign troops in UkraineOther points of the draft document, which will be handed over to Ukrainian President Poroshenko, define the signs of a military conflict inside the country, consider the increasing role of informational and psychological operations, and point out the necessity of an upgrade of the current system of mobilization and mobilization training.Commenting on the new doctrine, President Poroshenko said that its novelty is based on a shift of emphasis to a more complex use of military and non-military instruments.\u201cIt fundamentally changes the character of the armed struggle.

Would you agree with that assessment of Maidan?READ MORE: Kiev clashes, grenade explosion injure dozens during protests against constitutional lawRoger Annis: No not at all. In fact there is a growing body of evidence that researchers into the events on Maidan Square are showing that there was extreme violence practiced by the right-wing forces that were striving to overthrow the elected president at that time, and specifically the use of sniper fire on February 20. Now there is considerable evidence, including in the official investigation ongoing in the Ukraine itself, that the sniper fire that was blamed on the police of the government that was overthrown in fact came from the right-wing side. So that the right wing practices violence is no mystery to anyone, but perhaps these latest events in Kiev will give more impetus to a real and serious investigation into the extremely violent events on Maidan Square on February 20 and the days and weeks leading up to that.James Petras, Professor of Sociology at Binghamton University on latest protests in Kiev: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear that economically Ukraine is a basket case. Internally the Kiev regime is deeply divided and increasingly the conflicts are becoming violent. Svoboda and Right Sector groups have become very belligerent and are challenging the government\u2019s authority. I think the outside survival link is what holds Poroshenko in power. Without that\u2026 and the legislation to try to decentralize some of the issues that confront the country is a way of retaining outside support which is so necessary since Poroshenko has more or less lost it internally.\u201dRT: Back in January last year the US State Department even considered sanctions against the previous Yanukovich government for using force on Maidan square. Why was the attitude to Yanukovich so different when he tried to get his country in order?RA: Precisely, and in fact let\u2019s take that a little bit further. When we look at the so called violence that was carried out on Maidan Square for those months before the overthrow of the elected president, violence coming from the government\u2026 I'm not going to sit here and defend all the actions of the Yanukovich government, but they are grossly exaggerated. And at the same time the violence coming from the right-wing side striving to overthrow the government has been - as we are seeing by the reaction today from the State Department - has been mysteriously downgraded in a complete whitewash and cover-up, as I said the growing body of evidence about the sniper fire. So what we saw on Maidan Square was the unraveling of a conspiracy. And that requires a lot of evidence to be hushed up and silenced and it requires a massive media propaganda effort to convince the world that something rather opposite to what was taking place on Maidan Square, that a violent right wing uprising against an elected president was taking place. The US can't sell that to the world, they can't say \u201cwe supported a violent right wing protest against an elected president.\u201d They have that \u2026 fictional narrative of the actual events. And you know we're seeing today the very forces that were out there on Maidan Square 18 months ago, we see them in action again. And now this government is really reaping the whirlwind of the conspiracy that it was a part of it months ago.James Petras, Professor of Sociology at Binghamton University on latest protests in Kiev: \u201cThis could be the second Maidan too and it reflects that the government came to power illegitimately through violence and now is facing its own violent internal opposition. If Svoboda comes to power it will create turmoil on the borders, because these extremist groups look toward a confrontation with Russia, Belarus, and Moldova. It is an extremist group which has no understanding of the international alignments today.\u201dRT: Can these protests involving radicals escalate? And do you think Washington will back Poroshenko's government till the very end?RA: I'm not sure how much further this can go. The extreme right in Ukraine is in no position to overthrow this government in Kiev. This could not be solved internationally, not in the slightest. And so I think the right wing is making its points, we may see more of these violent protests, but they are in no position to overthrow the government. Now the government on the other hand [has got to use peaceful means] because it has obligations under the Minsk II ceasefire agreement which it is failing to carry out, including this proposed decentralization law, which is for the most part is an evasion by the Kiev government of its responsibilities and obligations under Minsk II.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.LISTEN MORE:", "articleHeader": "\n\n        \u2018Right wing practicing violence in Ukraine no mystery to anyone\u2019\n\n     \n\n    ", "articleBiased": true, "articleUrl": "http://www.rt.com/op-edge/313993-kiev-protests-right-wing/", "articleSrc": "RT"}, {"articleText": "TrendsUkraine turmoilThe protest started on Constitution Square in Kiev in front of the parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, where some 3,000 radicals gathered.Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov wrote on Facebook that \u201cone person was killed, 125 were injured, 12 people are being operated on and one soldier is in deep coma.

Therefore, there were dreams about the militants to be able to influence key foreign policy decisions, having the right to veto the entry of Ukraine into NATO and the EU,\" he explained.\u201cBut what they [Donetsk and Lugansk Regions] have got instead is a lean line about the features of local self-governance,\u201d Poroskenko stressed.The amendments saw all the provisions for \u201ca theoretical possibility of a special status for individual cities\u201d excluded from the constitution in order to eliminate \u201cthe slightest legal clues for the parade of sovereignty,\" he added.As for Donetsk and Lugansk, the local self-governance there is provided by a separate law, which \u201chas already been approved by the parliament on two occasions,\u201d Poroshenko said.\u201cMost of the articles of this law are now suspended.

However, that figure suddenly jumped more than 20-fold, as Poroshenko told Italy\u2019s Corriere della Sera in June that \u201con Putin\u2019s order, there are 200,000 men and an arsenal of armored vehicles, sophisticated missile systems and anti-air arms amassed in our territory.\u201dREAD MORE: From 9,000 to 200,000: Poroshenko\u2019s displays numeracy problem in counting \u2018Russian invaders\u2019The Ukrainian president has never provided any proof to back his claims, with Moscow denying its military presence in eastern Ukraine on numerous occasions.Moreover, OSCE observers monitoring the border between the two countries have said that they have never seen Russian military personnel or vehicles crossing into Ukraine.But it\u2019s not just Kiev, but also Washington, that is finding it hard to obtain reliable intelligence from the Donetsk and Lugansk Regions.In May, US Permanent Representative to NATO, Douglas Lute, admitted that his knowledge of the eastern Ukrainian conflict came mostly from social media.READ MORE: US NATO envoy: \u2018I get most info on Ukraine conflict from social networks\u2019\u201cWe should all ask ourselves: why is it that we know so little really about what is going on in Donbass [eastern Ukraine],\u201d Lute told the Friends of Europe Forum in Brussels, Belgium.\u201cI mean, frankly, I read more on social media about what is going on in the Donbass than I get from formal intelligence networks.

They consume American TV and movies. Teenagers in Siberia follow the street fashion of New York. Even in isolated Yakutia you will find people who can rap along to Kanye West or Jay Z. Many older people can manage a few bars of Elvis or Sinatra.The reverse is not true in the States. Few Americans could quote a bit of Pushkin. In fact, most US citizens have probably not even heard of him. Or Pasternak. Or Tolstoy. Regrettably, if you ask an average American for an opinion on Russia, the current likely answer is something that depicts the nation as their enemy.This is very, very sad. Especially when Russia has no desire to be an enemy of the US and is not a threat to any genuine American interests. Actually, Russia is not even much of a danger to most of the things it\u2019s supposed to be a danger to. Like the Baltic States, for instance. Or the EU project.However, relentless anti-Russia propaganda in the US corporate media has brought us to this point. American elites are now more united in their disdain for Russia than they ever were during the Cold War. During that period, dissenting voices were heard. Now, they are completely frozen out.Indeed, anybody with any real knowledge of Russia is\u00a0condemned as \u201cPutin\u2019s shill\u201d these days. Even academic\u00a0heavyweights like Stephen Cohen. Thus, we have the bizarre situation where most American mainstream media commentators on Russia are people who have either never lived in the country or haven\u2019t been there for years. Or both. If old Joe McCarthy himself was around, he\u2019d be on CNN every five minutes.\n                   Soldiers from the first company-sized contingent of about 150 U.S. paratroopers from the U.S. Army's 173rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team in Swidwin, northern west Poland April 23, 2014. \u00a9 Kacper Pempel / Reuters     \n                Nasty neoconsThe fact that genuine Russia analysts, who understand the country, have been replaced by neocon nutters who lump the nation in with the likes of Syria, ISIS and North Korea is, frankly, disturbing. Russia is not some martial lightweight; it\u2019s the globe\u2019s second strongest military power. Or maybe that\u2019s the whole point? Russia is bigger and scarier than the aforementioned and presenting it as an imminent danger is more likely to secure increases in defense spending?It\u2019s also interesting to note that, almost to a man (or woman), the media figures calling for confrontation with Russia are\u00a0the same people who pushed for conflict with Iraq, Libya and Syria.The current climate is toxic. Washington-Moscow relations are at all time low. The media, in both countries, fuels the tension. Yet, to understand where we are, we first need to understand how we got here.The American establishment hates Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin. For daring to challenge Washington\u2019s authority, he\u2019s been designated as the bad guy du jour. With Bin Laden and Saddam dead, many imagined that North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un would inherit this role. However, unlike Al Qaeda, North Korea is too weak and insular to threaten the US directly. To preserve the military budget, which increased dramatically since 2001, they need an existential danger. Russia fits the bill.It wasn\u2019t always like this. After Bin Laden\u2019s henchmen attacked the US on September 11, 2001, Putin was the first foreign leader to call President George W Bush. He offered what the US needed and far more than any NATO members did. Intelligence, supplies, access to central Asia and transit across Russian territory. Putin even threw in the Northern Alliance to help America defeat the Taliban. This wasn\u2019t popular with the Russian elite.Before Putin, the 90s-era Boris Yeltsin government bent over backward to help the US. Indeed, Yeltsin even gave Bill Clinton a map of the electronic bugs in the US embassy in Moscow as a sign of friendship. At this stage, NATO had just 12 member states to resist the \u201cSoviet threat.\u201dHow did the Bush administration repay Russian loyalty? They continued to expand NATO eastward, despite assurances to the last Soviet government that it would never happen. Now, NATO comprises 28 countries - and there are a few more on its waiting list.\n                   U.S. Army soldiers train during an exercise at the Adazi Training Area, Latvia. \u00a9 U.S. Army / Sgt. Stephen A. Gober / Reuters     \n                America continued to support every country and politician who portrayed themselves as a potential victim of Russia. While Putin was trying to foster a new era of cooperation, Washington just couldn\u2019t tear itself away from Cold War thinking. Kremlin bad, Kremlin\u2019s enemies good.Since the turn of the century, politicians in ex-USSR states have had a clear path to riches. Simply sound as anti-Russian as possible and voila, money and support beyond their wildest dreams will suddenly appear, all thanks to Uncle Sam. The formula is repeated time and time again. Thus, we have the bizarre situation where US taxpayers are bankrolling a smorgasbord of ex-Communists, neo-Nazis and corrupt oligarchs across the former Soviet Union.Russia has responded by developing ties with leaders opposed to the US. Syria\u2019s Assad, Venezuela\u2019s Chavez and Hungary\u2019s Orban. Again, a nonlinear combination of conflicting left-wingers and their right-wing opposites. Amid all these geopolitical games, it\u2019s like the Reagan-Gorbachev detente never happened. That said, Russia has so far restrained itself from actively supporting American enemies. If US hostility encourages Moscow to change tack, expect a run on tinned food and a Bay Of Pigs redux.Bought journalismAlas, US aggression appears to be intensifying. In this year\u2019s State of the Union speech, President Obama named only\u00a0one country as an American enemy - Russia. The other adversary mentioned was ISIL.In an earlier address, he also\u00a0equated Russia to the Ebola virus. A gloating Obama claimed that Russia\u2019s economy was\u00a0\u201cin tatters\u201d and that the state was \u201cisolated.\u201d Neither of these statements is true. In actual fact, in many regions - including Asia and Latin America - Russia has more friends than the US.Incessant propaganda reduces hopes of a thaw. Especially when most popular western press seems to simply regurgitate the government line these days. Again, the same useful idiots who shilled for the illegal Iraq war now turn their sights to Russia. For evidence of this, see Gekaufte Journalisten (Bought Journalism) by German journalist Udo Ulfkotte. In the bestseller, the former editor at Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung explains how many stories in the German media are essentially planted by the CIA.At the same time, anti-Russia rhetoric in the US reaches new levels. Americans are bombarded with daily fear-mongering propaganda about \u201cRussian aggression.\u201d This is particularly pronounced on Fox News and CNN, where figures such as retired Major General Robert Scales\u00a0bombard the airwaves daily. Scales recently called for America \"to start killing Russians ... killing so many Russians that even Putin's media can't hide the fact that Russians are returning to the motherland in body bags.\u201dOddly, Russia is reducing media spending. This year, TASS news agency announced a 25 percent staff reduction and Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the state\u2019s official publication service (which also oversees Russia Beyond The Headlines and Russia Direct in foreign languages),\u00a0released 10 percent of its employees. Also, RT's budget is down 46 percent in dollar terms this year.Shaken, not stirredMeanwhile. Putin is smeared as a cross between a new Hitler and a James Bond villain. The Russian president is accused of nostalgia for the Soviet Union. In reality, Putin is a Russian nationalist. Indeed, his\u00a0political mentor was Anatoly Sobchak, a noted and outspoken opponent of communism. Putin\u2019s KGB past is also frequently used against him. In fact, the President was a low-ranking administrator, not a *Stirlitz-esque spy.LISTEN MORE:Putin himself believes that the west is implementing a policy of \u201ccontainment\u201d against Russia. Even the \u201cshadow-CIA,\u201d US-political intelligence firm Stratfor broadly\u00a0agrees with this assessment. The agency\u2019s chief, George Friedman, has often stated that US policy is to prevent a rival power emerging in Eurasia. In simple terms, this means that Washington loves Moscow when it\u2019s weak, as in the 90s, but fears a successful Russia which could rival it.Hence, the Kremlin now realises that using cooperation with the west to fuel economic growth is futile. This explains Russia\u2019s enthusiasm for the BRICs movement. It has also led to a nascent alliance with China, one that may not be in Moscow\u2019s long-term interests. However, Putin has calculated that the alternative, meekly cowering before Washington, is worse.As Moscow-Washington relations atrophy, there are now two scenarios in play. America can continue its aggression and Putin, a moderate by Russian standards, could feel compelled to dust off the Soviet playbook. This would mean a tit-for-tat campaign to destabilise America's near abroad as Washington has done, or attempted to do, in Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia and Moldova. The far better option would be for the US to take a step back and attempt a rapprochement with Moscow before the present acrimony becomes systemic.*Stirlitz (Maxim Maximovich Isaev) was a fictional Soviet spy, created by Yulian Semyonov.

Perhaps it\u2019s an attempt to discredit what RT has reported, what other news outlets have reported; perhaps it is an attempt to walk back away from these wild accusations, these unfounded allegations that have been put out there into the blogosphere and into the online media world without any substantiation.It is unclear exactly what has happened here. But I think the larger question, the one that really comes to my mind immediately is: what has happened to the standards of journalism, especially in the so-called trusted Western media?If you look at a number of examples in the context of Ukraine, whether it was the rush to blame Russia and Putin for downing flight MH17; whether it was the purported Russian tanks crossing the border of Ukraine, as The Guardian and many others have reported. We\u2019ve seen over, and over, and over again a pattern of lies, distortions and exaggerations that have been perpetrated by the Western media not simply because they want to plant these facts, although it\u2019s part of it, but it is to drive a particular narrative, it is to drive the political agenda of the US and its Western allies where they are in need to make Russia into a villain, and the West into the backers and supporters of \u2018good guys\u2019. Because that narrative has fallen away, because it is broken down so much, now they are moving to even more underhanded tactics, as we\u2019ve seen in recent days.RT:\u00a0Are claims like this potentially damaging to the ongoing peace process in Ukraine?ED: On the one hand, they can certainly shift some political opinion or, rather I should say, public opinion, although political opinion as well. I think at the larger level it\u2019s mostly irrelevant as it pertains to the powers that would be negotiating such a settlement. The real question, perhaps, is the main hurdle to any kind of a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine is simply the fact that the so-called government of Kiev is clearly and unmistakably a puppet government of the US and of the West, one that is holding on for dear life as an economy crashes around it, as it has a public in Ukraine that is increasingly discontented, increasingly dissatisfied, and increasingly becoming radicalized. Those Nazi groups, the Pravy Sektor [Right Sector] and the Azov Battalion, and all of the rest of these fascist organizations have tremendous sway in Ukraine, they have tremendous fire power behind them. I think the real obstacle to peace isn\u2019t so much some fake report from Forbes or from some obscure Russian website \u2013 it is these elements who will stop at nothing to get the war that they want and that they have lost all along.\n                   \u00a9 Igor Zarembo / RIA Novosti     \n                \u2018Internet creates presumption of correctness\u2019Legal analyst and media commentator Lionel suggests that the better the website, graphics and layout, the more it\u2019s trusted.

What do you make of that?Lionel: I\u2019m surprised it took this long. I\u2019m surprised we haven\u2019t found more of this. I\u2019m surprised for a variety of reasons. Look there is a presumption of correctness that people have. The better the site, the better the graphics, the better the layout - the more it\u2019s trusted. We are now in a world that turns to Wikipedia as an absolute fact basis, after all its Wikipedia. Then we have satire sites, we have the Onion here, where people have sometimes confused the Onion with actual news. Sometimes people have actually cited deliberately bogus and satirical sites because there is a presumption of correctness, a presumption of legitimacy\u2026RT: So you are not surprised at the lack of questions from some major publications?L: That\u2019s the point that gets me and if you look at the provenance of this author you would think that especially when the subject matter is such that is by its very nature very intriguing and very shocking you would think there would be a little bit of an inquiry just to play it safe. But the internet and the graphics have created the illusion. Again a presumption of correctness. And what we are going to find out is - more and more of these stories, of these websites, are going to be set up in the hope that nobody will check them\u2026.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0RT: Will it extend to the wider public as well, will this? If you sensed when you\u2019ve seen this story and talk to the public about it, have you sensed that they are sort of appalled by what they see as well or are they just pushing it to one side saying that this thing happens?L: No, nothing appalls it. Listen to give you an example - there is a joke on the internet that says \u201cNever believe everything you read on the internet,\u201d and it cites Abraham Lincoln. It\u2019s a joke and it shows you the inherent irony and the satire of that. Do you know how many people I\u2019ve seen actually cite that? Abraham Lincoln referring to the internet? Because there is again this presumption of correctness. I can tell you every single day there is a story that is absolutely absurd and you will read online in various social media - which is another story - where people say \u201cNo, this is satirical\u201d. When the Onion started here in this country people didn\u2019t know what it was because it looked like a newspaper, felt like a newspaper, it had the graphics of a newspaper and then again the presumption of such took place. So the good news is that maybe by virtue of this story and others it will force newsrooms around the world to look deeper and not necessarily believe everything they see. I hope.

It is mounted above ground level on the surface or in trees to give the greatest dispersion of fragments and impact radius.Both mines are illegal under the international Ottawa Treaty, as they can be indiscriminately activated potentially by non-combatants.Ukraine signed the so-called Mine Ban Treaty in 1999 and ratified it in 2005.

Once you demonize the leader this gives you license to attack the country, or bomb it - in the case of Russia that would be too dangerous to do, thank God.You have sanctions against the country, make life difficult for them. You say \u201cRussia was aggressive, look at how it grabbed Crimea\u201d. But they didn\u2019t really. Crimea had belonged to Russia for over 240 years or so. It was taken away by a Soviet leader \u2013 Nikita Khrushchev who himself was Ukrainian and Crimea was given to Ukraine. When Crimea voted itself back as part of Russia, 93 percent voted in favor of returning to Russia and that\u2019s where they belonged historically and ethnically and linguistically and also because the social programs and benefits would be better for them and they chose that. And the people in Eastern Ukraine are also trying to word off the Nazi incursions that are coming in, and Kiev bullying and the lie. So that\u2019s my perspective of what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0\n                   Servicemen of the US and Lithuanian armies during a joint exercise on mopping up terrorists during the Rapid Trident-2015 multinational drill on the Yavorovo testing grounds. \u00a9 Stringer / RIA Novosti     \n                RT: NATO boasts that the \"training has been adapted to the requests of Ukrainians.\u201d Why do you think they're putting so much emphasis on the significance of this boot camp?MP: I think what they fear is not a troubled Russia but a successful Russia. They fear any country whether it be China, Russia, Venezuela, Iraq under Saddam Hussein - who was not a hero and somebody to admire, he worked for the CIA. But when Saddam Hussein suddenly showed himself to be independent and wanting a larger part of the oil quota, when he refused to hand over the oil companies to the British and American petroleum companies, when he kept almost the entire economy state-owned and publicly owned, then the Americans started to find him very troublesome. They decided that he was somebody who was a threat to the US. He was not a threat to the US, but he was a threat to US corporate capitalism and that is something they could not tolerate. The Empire only has two types of people on its borders. It has either satellites who are potential enemies -I mean the satellites who are obedient and follow you - or enemies or potential enemies.They fear Russia if it doesn\u2019t cooperate and do what they want and doesn\u2019t vote the way they want in the UN and accept the oil quotas that the US cartels put up. When those things happen, they are not bothered. But that isn\u2019t what they tell the American people, they tell the American people that this man or that leader is hostile toward us, that he is almost like Hitler, he has secret weapons of mass destruction. These fantasy stories don\u2019t go anywhere, they don\u2019t tell anybody anything and that is what we are seeing today. Ukraine is just another little piece of puppetry in that direction. They have troops right on the Russian border in Latvia, Estonia, and Poland. Ukraine is not geopolitically crucial to American national security. If anything the threat is to Russia of course. It would be like Russian troops in Mexico, where would the Americans be? And they would be going hysterical, really worked up, wouldn\u2019t they?The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.LISTEN MORE:", "articleHeader": "\n\n         \u2018What US fears is not troubled, but successful Russia\u2019\n\n     \n\n    ", "articleBiased": true, "articleUrl": "http://www.rt.com/op-edge/312940-nato-drills-ukraine-russia/", "articleSrc": "RT"}, {"articleText": "Think back to March 2014, when the Crimean referendum took place. The condemnation of Russia was intense. Putin paid a visit to Crimea in May of that year following the \u2018annexation\u2019. This triggered a tough response from Washington. \u201cCrimea belongs to Ukraine and we don\u2019t recognize of course the illegal and illegitimate steps by Russia in that regard,\u201d declared US State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki.Putin\u2019s visit to Crimea this week - when he took a dive in a mini submarine to explore Byzantine era wreckage off Crimea\u2019s Black Sea coast - was noticeably different. There were jibes about Putin looking like \u2018a Bond villain;\u2019 there were jokes about him looking for signs of the ruble; there were also references to the Kursk submarine disaster, which took place fifteen years earlier.Anti-Putin activists claim President Putin keeps doing stunts in submarines so search engines find fewer references to Kursk sub tragedy\u2014 Daniel Sandford (@BBCDanielS) August 18, 2015However, Ukraine\u2019s President Poroshenko\u2019s fierce condemnation of the visit - he called it \u201ca challenge to the civilized world\u201d - seemed to fall on deaf ears, as none of the major Western leaders criticized Putin\u2019s trip to the \u2018annexed\u2019 peninsula.This lack of outrage was mirrored in the Western MSM coverage.Sky News referred to Putin as \u201cdaring.\u201d CNN in its coverage of the event used Sevastopol, Crimea as the locator and not Ukraine (though they did state on their website that Crimea was \u201cUkrainian territory\u201d). Putin\u2019s visit was described elsewhere as \u2018controversial\u2019, but that\u2019s about as far as it went.How much should one read in to all of this? The muted reaction to Putin\u2019s visit is not the only sign that things could be calming down. Crimea has already been visited by a delegation of French MPs from Nicolas Sarkozy\u2018s Republican Party. Italian Parliamentarians have announced plans to visit. It\u2019s been reported that Polish MPs are\u00a0mulling a trip to the peninsula, as are MPs from Germany\u2019s progressive Die Linke party.It\u2019s ludicrous to think that they\u2019re all going there just to bring back some cheap cigarettes.\u201cI think that the French parliamentarian\u2019s trip was a right thing to do. Being elected by the people it was their duty to tell and show the official French authorities, politicians and the society as a whole what is really going on in Crimea right now. This is a correct and demonstrative decision,\u201d Die Linke\u2019s Alexander Neu said.The very fact that delegations of Western politicians are going - and planning to go - to Crimea tells us that they don\u2019t think it will cost them domestic popularity - which is revealing in itself. It shows that you can win political points on the Crimea issue in Europe.It\u2019s not just politicos who are making their way to the peninsula, but music stars too. American rock star Joe Lynn Turner, a former vocalist with Rainbow and Deep Purple, arrived in Crimea this week to give a series of concerts.\u201cI know the truth lives here. And I believe right now, this time Russia is going to be the great power that it already has been and that good always overcomes evil,\u201d Turner\u00a0told reporters.\u201cI was warned I could be banned in Europe [for giving concerts in Crimea]\u2026 but I am a rebel, I have always been a rebel and I will always stay a rebel. I do not care what they say.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve listened to every leader in the world. The only one telling the truth is Putin,\u201d Turner said.Also this week, the Italian tenor Federico Lepre of La Scala, Milan, performed in Yalta in Crimea with Russian singer Natalia Pavlova-Colantoni of the Moscow State Conservatory.The hope of the neocons that a strict Western boycott of Crimea would be observed has clearly not been realized. Even though visiting the province doesn\u2019t necessarily mean endorsement of it being part of Russia - it does show cracks in the \u2018hard-line\u2019 approach. Singers, literally and metaphorically, are walking away from the West\u2019s chorus of condemnation.Here\u2019s why it\u2019s happening. For a start, the neocons argument, which goes something like, \u201cCrimea\u2019s annexation by Russia proves that Putin is the new Hitler,\u201d never really gained much traction - certainly not among the general public.Such a position was fatally weakened by the fact that Crimea was part of Russia between 1783 and 1954 (when it was transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic by Khrushchev) and the fact that the majority of people who live there are, er, Russians. You don\u2019t have to be a hardcore Russian nationalist with the Russia flag tattooed on your biceps to acknowledge that Russia does have pretty strong claims to the province.Western journalists who do know a bit of regional history have undermined the neocon cause.Peter Hitchens, a columnist for Britain\u2019s Mail on Sunday newspaper wrote \u2019A (not so brief) history of Crimea\u2019 that provided some much needed historical background.He also highlighted Western double standards on the Crimean referendum in\u00a0another piece entitled, \u2018Why don\u2019t we want democracy and self-determination for Crimea?\u2019In The Guardian, Seumas Milne, in an\u00a0article entitled, 'The clash in Crimea is the fruit of Western expansion,' wrote that: \u201cWestern denunciations of Russian intervention in Crimea have reached new depths of self-parody.\u201d\u00a0READ MORE: Kissinger: \u2018Breaking Russia has become objective for US\u2019In the Sunday Telegraph, in December 2014, Christopher Booker wrote: \u201cQuite one of the oddest and most frightening stories of the year has been the ludicrous and persistent misrepresentation in the West of the reason for the tragic shambles unfolding over Russia and Ukraine. This has been presented as wholly the fault of the Russian \u2018dictator\u2019 Vladimir Putin, compared by Hillary Clinton and the Prince of Wales to Hitler, for his \u2018annexing\u2019 of Crimea\u2026 it was entirely predictable that Russia and the ethnic Russians of eastern Ukraine would respond as they have done. So, too, was the wish of the vast majority of Crimeans, 82 percent of them Russian speakers, to rejoin the country of which they were part for most of two centuries.\u201dThe political context surrounding the return of Crimea to Russia also weakened the Russophobes\u2019 case. Let\u2019s not forget Crimea would still be part of Ukraine today had it not been for the Western-sponsored toppling of a democratically elected government in Kiev in February 2014. Crimea\u2019s referendum was a direct consequence of a \u2019regime change\u2019 which Western leaders welcomed.That regime change shattered the consensus under which the country had been governed since the end of the Soviet Union, and which reflected the divisions in the country. The basis of that consensus was that democratic election results would be respected, and that the leaders of Ukraine would also make compromises on foreign policy orientation - maintaining friendly relations with both Russia and the West and not going out of their way to antagonize either.The consensus also meant respecting the full language and other rights of Ukraine\u2019s minorities. All that was shattered by what happened in February 2014. Ukraine\u2019s Russian population felt threatened by the ousting of a President and a government they had largely supported - and in particular were concerned over the prominent role that virulently anti-Russian far-right groups played in the so-called \u2018democratic\u2019 uprising.READ MORE: US boxer Roy Jones Jr. asks for Russian passport over cup of tea with Putin in Crimea Regardless of whether or not we regard the referendum of March 2014 as legal or illegal, constitutional or unconstitutional, it\u2019s easy to understand why the majority of people of Crimea decided that with neo-Nazis on the rampage and a fiercely anti-Russia administration in power in Kiev, it was time to say \u2019dosvedanya\u2019 to Ukraine and return to Mother Russia.The case for regarding Crimea\u2019s return to Russia as the most heinous of crimes has also not been helped by the observable fact that those who cried most loudly about how \u2018outrageous\u2019 Crimea\u2019s \u2018annexation\u2019 was, were also cheerleaders for the illegal invasion of Iraq.Asked which was worse - illegally invading a sovereign state on the basis of whopping big lie (WMDs) in order to grab its resources and extend your regional hegemony - or a province retuning to a country it had been part of for the best part of two centuries after a referendum - then all but the wild-eyed inhabitants of Planet Neocon would say the former. Let\u2019s not forget too that up to one million have lost their lives following the illegal \u2018Shock and Awe\u2019 invasion of Iraq - while the \u2018heinous annexation\u2019 of Crimea that had the West\u2019s endless war lobby foaming at the mouth, was relatively bloodless - with only one Ukrainian soldier unfortunately killed.Today, three positions on Crimea can be discerned. We can take the line that there the return of the province was entirely legitimate. The referendum was democratic and represented the will of the people. It couldn\u2019t be unconstitutional, because violent toppling of a democratically elected government in Kiev meant that the old Ukrainian constitution was effectively torn up.We can take the neocon line that holding a referendum was an act of aggression on a par with the Nazis attacking Poland/Czechoslovakia/Low Countries, etc and was a sign that \u2018Russian imperialism\u2019 threatens the entire world (unlike the \u2018benign\u2019 liberal invasions, oops, interventions, against sovereign states that the US and its allies have engaged in over the past 20 years and which have, er.. brought so much peace and stability to the Middle East and beyond).Or we can take a third position, which is the one I\u2019d say reflects where quite a few Western politicians are now, even though they might not openly admit it for fear of being branded \u2018Putin appeasers.' This position is: \u201cWhile we believe Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity should have been maintained, it\u2019s hardly worth risking world war three over to get a historical province of Russia, populated by Russians to return to Ukraine and we need to try and get things back to normal.\u201dThe reality is Crimea is now part of Russia again - and no amount of neocon rage will change this.European businesses - and particularly manufacturing companies - are losing out over the anti-Russian sanctions and would like to see them lifted. There is no real appetite outside of Russophobic circles to push things further. A new Crimean war is highly unlikely.It\u2019s also important to point out that the West - whether it likes it or not - needs Putin\u2019s cooperation on a number of issues, particularly in the Middle East. The nuclear deal with Iran was only achieved with the Kremlin\u2019s help. If Western leaders are serious about defeating ISIS (admittedly a big \u2018if\u2019 considering how much Western powers and their regional allies have enabled ISIS), then Russia assistance will be crucial. In the words of that well known left-wing peacenik Henry Kissinger: \u201cFor the West the demonization of Putin is not a foreign policy - it\u2019s an alibi for the absence of one.\u201dCrimea remains subject to harsh western sanctions and is likely to be referred to as \u2018illegally annexed\u2019 for quite some time yet. In March, the US vowed to maintain sanctions as long as Russia\u2019s \u2018occupation\u2019 continued.Nevertheless, the muted reaction to Putin\u2019s visit this week must have made the neocons and those who do want to risk WW3 over Crimea rather concerned that things are gradually changing.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.LISTEN MORE:", "articleHeader": "\n\n        Putin goes to Crimea \u2013 but where\u2019s the Western outrage?\n\n     \n\n    ", "articleBiased": true, "articleUrl": "http://www.rt.com/op-edge/313008-crimea-putin-media-western", "articleSrc": "RT"}, {"articleText": "TrendsUkraine turmoilUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko is making \u201cunthinkable, crazy statements\u201d in order to stir up the situation, Sergey Lavrov said Monday at a news conference after meeting Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.READ MORE: MH17 probe not truly independent and intl tribunal aimed at hiding its ineffectiveness \u2013 LavrovSergey Lavrov quoted an interview given by the Ukrainian president to the French daily Liberation, in which Petro Poroshenko said that \u201cPutin wants all of Europe.\u201d\u201cA person who makes such statements is concerned more with sustaining Russophobia in the West, thereby distracting attention from an inability to fulfill what he signed up for,\u201d Lavrov said, adding that a simple comparison of what Poroshenko had agreed to and what Kiev had actually done would be \u201ca very entertaining process.\u201d\u201cMoscow is ready for a conversation on this issue with those who guaranteed the trustworthiness of Kiev\u2019s actions,\u201d the Russian FM said.US \u2018recognized\u2019 E.

Under Western political microscopes criminality has been defined by geography, political worth and financial solvency \u2013 oddities such as international laws carry little weight compared to absolute political pragmatism.Only this week, one of America and Britain's most loyal partners in the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was left shamefaced as UK residents circulated a petition demanding his arrest for war crimes against Gaza during the 2014 summer offensive. Inspired by Damian Moran, the petition has already generated much media coverage due to the implications it carries for the UK government.READ MORE: The messy US \u2018strategy\u2019 in Syria Filed on the UK Parliament website, the petition, if signed by 100,000 people, would force government officials to open a public debate. This is clearly something politicians have been keen to avoid in view of Israel's litany of well -documented aggravated human rights violations and war crimes \u2013 notwithstanding Britain's own guilt in quietly standing by while thousands of unarmed civilians were marked for murder.\"Benjamin Netanyahu is to hold talks in London this September. Under international law he should be arrested for war crimes upon arrival in the UK for the massacre of over 2,000 civilians in 2014,\" reads the petition.While it is likely that Moran's campaign will be buried and forgotten \u2013 or so the Establishment hopes \u2013 such efforts on the part of the public to expose western dealings, and hold officials accountable before the judiciary, are a sure sign of the growing dichotomy between the people and their leaders.If the United States could still claim in the wake of World War II to be a power for good, a democratic lighthouse for aspiring modern civil states, its taste for political meddling and covert military dealings have turned this once-promising American idealism into the very despotic force it vowed to always oppose.America's first brush with political imperialism would come in 1953 when then-US President Dwight Eisenhower engineered the overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh because he had the temerity to challenge Britain's monopoly on Iranian oil. While London had been clever enough to play the Cold War card to secure Washington's cooperation, US officials were more than happy to oblige in the undermining of a democracy.READ MORE: 45,000 demand Israel PM Netanyahu\u2019s arrest for \u2018war crimes\u2019 during UK state visit As a result of America's intervention, Iran spent the next two decades under the thumb of a tyrant \u2013 America's very own friend in Tehran: Mohammad Reza Shah. Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci would write of the Shah: \"He is a highly dangerous megalomaniac because he combines the worst of the old and the worst of the new.\"Interestingly, as Britain\u2019s empire receded into the shadows, America rose to become the leading venture imperialist par excellence. Vladimir Lenin's predictions on the development of capitalism into neo-imperialism were proved absolutely correct.In \"Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism,\" Lenin advances the theory that modern-day imperialism has been fueled by rabid economic ambitions - capitalism, in contrast to other forms of colonialism: i.e. military expansionism.As Phil Gasper explains: \"Lenin's argument was that the rivalries and wars between capitalist powers were inherent in one of capitalism's basic features: the tendency for capital to become more centralized and concentrated \u2013 in other words, for the dominant capitalist firms to acquire monopoly or near-monopoly status in particular sectors of their national economy.\"On its way down the moral ladder, and up on Neo-Imperial Avenue, western powers, Washington and London in the lead, have cultivated rather interesting friendships \u2013 several, one might venture, irreconcilable with \u201cwestern values.\u201dAmong those favored by the West once figured late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, late Libyan Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and the former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Those autocrats were of course quickly discarded as political dynamics shifted, opening the door to new friendships: Saudi King Salman, Egyptian President Abd El Sisi\u2026 the list goes on.READ MORE: Netanyahu \u2018urged European leaders to support\u2019 resolution against Israel In the eyes of the West, political stability takes precedence overall, no matter how violent the regime or criminal the means of repression \u2013 capitalism, after all, thrives in a controlled environment.When Saudi King Abdullah died in January this year, US President Obama visited his successor, accompanied by a platoon of state officials, including the CIA director, who took great pains in declaring his undying admiration for the late king and offering his utmost support to the new monarch. The fact that King Salman has sent several dozen men to their deaths since his coronation, mostly for daring to exercise freedom of expression, raised not an eyebrow in Washington.But if America is blind to its allies' \u201cindiscretions,\" such courtesies are not extended to those rogue powers which have had the audacity of remaining independent. Russia, most of all, knows the bite of western hypocrisy.Slammed for denouncing foreign political meddling in Syria, Moscow suffered sanctions for its partaking in the protection of Crimea against the rise of Ukraine\u2019s far-right.

We\u2019ve seen rallies mounting since Russia adopted its EU food embargo last year. How badly is the embargo, which was in response to Western sanctions on Russia, hurting Europe\u2019s economy?Mattias Westman: Well, I think on the overall European economy it has limited impact, but of course some of the more vulnerable groups, in farming communities and also particularly in the south and south-east of Europe are suffering more than others.RT:\u00a0Key Western leaders have also promoted the extension of sanctions on Russia on numerous occasions. Do you consider sanctions an appropriate way to deal with Moscow?MW: Well, in a recent\u00a0article I published in a German magazine I tried to sort this question out from a more usefulness point of view. I would say it\u2019s very difficult to see how these sanctions could have any beneficial effect on Russia or on the situation in Ukraine.RT:\u00a0US President Barack Obama has also been weighing in again on numerous occasions. He said that Western sanctions have clearly damaged the Russian economy. Do you agree with that sentiment?MW: Well, I think it\u2019s not entirely correct. I mean, of course the sanctions have had some negative impact, but the slowdown we\u2019ve seen in Russia in the last year, I think has a lot more to do with the price of commodities; the price of oil has fallen by 50 percent, which inevitably was going to have an effect on the Russian economy, particularly on the ruble. And I think the Central Bank did the right thing in terms of allowing the ruble to fluctuate and to decline with the terms of trade in order to preserve the margins and the competitiveness of the Russian industry.RT:\u00a0In your article, you said that the Western approach towards Russia over Ukraine was kind of an \u2018own goal\u2019 of historic proportions. What do you mean by that?MW: Well, I think that there is a lot of talk in the West about Russia being a threat to the global system or the global security. But I think the real challenge to the global balance of power, as it is, is really China, which is a rapidly rising power. And by taking this aggressive stance against Russia, a confrontational stance I should say, you have the effect of Russia and China cooperating further and that only strengthens this more serious threat to the global dominance of the West \u2013 of course, if that is a beneficial thing.RT:\u00a0You just mentioned China. Amid the sanctions, we saw Russia signing a record trillion dollar deal with the Chinese. Do you think the West is losing a key economic partner?MW: Well, I think this process is to some extent inevitable because the Chinese and Russian economies are very compatible and there are many benefits from trade between the countries, but I think that this try to politicize the relationships, and driving a conflict, is speeding up that process. And I think seeing Russia and China as strategic allies is not really in their interests, but that\u2019s the effect of the policies that they are pursuing.RT:\u00a0What are your predictions for the future? And in terms of sanctions what needs to actually happen for them to be lifted on both sides?MW: Well, it\u2019s two different things here. The USA is unlikely to lift sanctions anytime soon; it is politically inconvenient to do so \u2013 to look weak against Russia and so on. The situation in Europe is quite different. First of all, it requires unanimous decisions to prolong the sanctions when they come up to you again in January, I think. And already in the summer, now, when they were prolonged for six months, there are lot countries who didn\u2019t want to do it. As far as I understand there were about seven hawks who wanted to prolong them, seven doves who wanted to lift them, and the rest were somewhere in the middle. And I think each time it will become harder and harder to bully the countries who want to lift the sanctions. So, of course, the current situation, where things are, after all, calming down a little bit in Ukraine, and you see that the reverse sanctions biting a bit in the south of Europe \u2013 I think that increases the likelihood of lifting sanctions. And I also think they (America) probably might not want to spend so much political capital on bullying their countries into agreeing on prolongation very much longer.RT:\u00a0Just finally, Russia denies being involved in the military conflict in Ukraine, yet it\u2019s being sanctioned for its alleged role in the war, while Kiev does enjoy a lot of support from the West. What are your thoughts on that overall picture?MW: Well, of course, it is a very complex question, but I think is unfortunate that the West has taken such a strong side for one part of an internal conflict in Ukraine. And I think there\u2019s a lack of understanding of what the causes of this conflict are. Hopefully \u2013 and I have seen some signs of it \u2013 that some more awareness is coming on that this is not as simple as it might have looked from the beginning.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.", "articleHeader": "\n\n        \u2018West\u2019s aggressive stance pushes Russia to China, threatens Western dominance\u2019\n\n     \n\n    ", "articleBiased": true, "articleUrl": "http://www.rt.com/op-edge/312132-russia-china-western-dominance/", "articleSrc": "RT"}, {"articleText": "Britain was late to the Lottery game.

Soon, a Lancashire lady called Mystic Meg was a household name. Meg\u2019s slot was good fun. The pseudo-psychic would attempt to predict facts about the future winner. Of course, Meg was usually very wrong. Her repeated failures became something of a national institution and the butt of countless jokes.Not being a fan of 14 million to 1 bets, I haven\u2019t followed the Lottery too closely since. Nor Meg\u2019s career. However, I\u2019ve long suspected that the hapless clairvoyant might have inspired a lot of the commentary one reads on Russia in the Western media. Some of the predictions over the years have made Mystic Meg look entirely believable.Hardly a month goes by when somebody isn\u2019t predicting Russia\u2019s imminent demise. The conspiracy theories usually vary. However, regular suspects are the collapse of the government, a Chechen war redux, a demographic implosion or an invasion by China.The daddy of them all came back in 1999 when Anders Aslund predicted \u2018Russia\u2019s Collapse\u2019 in a seminal Foreign Affairs\u00a0article. This groundbreaking piece pioneered the, then innovative, use of complete nonsense to scare the living daylights out of people in the West. It frightened investors, students and anybody who had any intention of discovering Russia at that time.A Swedish Oxford graduate, Aslund had worked as an adviser to Boris Yeltsin\u2019s notoriously incompetent 1990\u2019s administration in Moscow. The \u2018shock therapy\u2019 prescribed by Aslund caused untold misery across Russia. Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz described the policy as \u201ca failure.\u201dNevertheless, in \u201999, a year after an economic crash had sidelined Aslund\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9s at the Kremlin, he twisted the knife. Amazingly, some still take Aslund seriously as a Russia analyst. Earlier this year, he\u00a0predicted that Russia\u2019s economy would contract by 10 percent in 2015. The World Bank\u00a0estimates 2.7%. On the basis that a stopped clock is right twice a day, Aslund has been trying to advise Ukraine, through the\u00a0opinion pages of the Kyiv Post. Ukraine, frankly, has more than enough problems already.Aslund\u2019s continued presence serves as proof that nobody ever went hungry from being continuously wrong on Russia. This surely warms the hearts of editors at the Economist magazine, where Mystic Meg may, or may not, work these days. Due to the fact that its articles aren\u2019t deemed worthy of by-lines, this is unclear.As Business New Europe\u2019s Ben Aris pointed out last year, the Economist has \u201can institutional hatred\u201d of Russia. \u201cThose who cover and invest in Russia have long ago cancelled their subscriptions to the Economist; in Moscow at least it has a reputation for bias and selective reporting that makes its coverage next to useless,\u201d the experienced Moscow correspondent wrote.Not content with weekly digs at Russia, that extend from the subtle to the crude, the Economist finally ran the full gamut of A to Z last week and hit rock bottom. In an\u00a0article titled \u201cIf Russia Breaks Up,\u201d\u00a0 they took the biscuit to the extent that the proverbial Cheesecake was denuded. Attempting to conflate the Ukrainian civil war with the 1904-05 Russo-Japanese war, the anonymous Economist author made the magazine look even more silly than usual.\n                   \u00a9 Ilya Naymushin / Reuters     \n                The Economist\u2019s supposition centered on the ill-informed notion that there exists a groundswell of support for Siberia separatism. Even more ridiculously the magazine alleged that the dominant Far Eastern cities of Vladivostok and Khabarovsk are \u201cmore economically integrated with China and South Korea than they are with the European part of Russia.\u201dThis is inaccurate on so many levels. In fact, the precise problem with the Russian Far East is that it\u2019s not integrated enough with east Asia and far too reliant on Europe and the rest of Russia for trade. Aside from a few ramshackle \u2018Chinese markets\u2019 and the odd Korean restaurant, Khabarovsk is as European as Galway or Lisbon, despite being over 6,000 km from the Ural Mountains. Recognizing the problem, the Kremlin has recently designated\u00a0sections of the Far East as \u201cspecial economic zones.\u201d If Moscow feared a breakaway, it would hardly make sense for it to encourage integration between the region and its Asian neighbors.The Economist is not alone in the sudden, rather bonkers, obsession with the notion that the Russian state might disintegrate through Siberian separatism. Of course, it hardly needs mentioning that the periodicals own home nation, the UK, is much more likely to combust as Scottish nationalists become increasingly dominant in Edinburgh and Ulster's demographics point to a United Ireland before long.In the past month, both Quartz and the Wilson Quarterly have been beating the same drum. The former, headquartered at Washington\u2019s iconic Watergate, is owned by Atlantic Media, which specializes in government-targeted publications. Meanwhile, the latter is\u00a0controlled by the US capital\u2019s Wilson Centre. Incidentally, Aslund has been\u00a0associated with the institution.The Wilson Quarterly\u2019s Elizabeth Peet, a newcomer to Russia-focused journalism, based her entire\u00a0argument on a Eurozine report by Stanislav Zakharkin. In turn, Zakharkin seems to have been inspired by a 2011 rally in Novosibirsk, titled \u2018Stop Feeding Moscow.\u2019 According to local sources, the protest was attended by the grand total of 100 people. Straws. At. Clutching. That was 100 folk in a city of 1.5 million souls. I\u2019ve seen longer bus queues in Russia.Not to be outdone, Quartz went for the jugular. Written by one Bradley Jardine, the\u00a0article asked, \u201cCould surging Siberian nationalism break up Russia?\u201d When I stopped laughing, I realized that the author had interned at the US propaganda outlet, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The same RFE/RL that\u00a0fired a Russian journalist last year for attempting to tell the truth about Ukrainian war atrocities. Perhaps, if Andrey Babitsky was still employed, he could have advised Bradley Jardine on the ridiculousness of his argument.Jardine hilariously invokes \u2018tensions\u2019 and \u2018hostility\u2019 between Moscow and Siberia. He describes the 100-person march in Novosibirsk as a \u201cmajor rally.\u201dNow for the reality: there is more chance of Texas separating from the USA than Siberia suddenly shunting away from Russia. For starters, historic Siberia is 77 percent of Russia\u2019s total land area. The Siberian Federal District is 30 percent. Hence, even in the very unlikely event of Russian collapse, it would be the rest of the country separating from it.\n                   \u00a9 Ilya Naymushin / Reuters     \n                There\u2019s also the fact that Siberia & the Russian Far East are more uniformly Slavic (95 percent) and Orthodox Christian than most \u2018European\u2019 Russian regions. This includes Moscow, which allegedly has a 91-percent ethnic Russian population, but that doesn\u2019t account for the vagaries of Russia\u2019s registration system. Furthermore, Asian Russians are generally more integrated than Caucasus Muslims, for instance.This is not to say that Siberia\u2019s demographic make-up is the sole reason for its continued loyalty to Russia. Aside from cultural ties, Siberia needs the protection of the Russian state. Alone, its more densely populated Asian neighbors would overwhelm it.However, natives never discuss such concerns. For one simple reason - Siberia is as Russian as Balalaikas and Seld Pod Shuboi (a famous herring-based salad). There\u2019s no desire in Novosibirsk to exit the Russian Federation and most locals would guffaw at the suggestion.There\u2019s also no danger of Yorkshire departing from the UK, Provence leaving France or Colorado separating from the USA. Quite correctly, the Economist, Quartz and the Wilson Quarterly don\u2019t even entertain such crazy notions.

What's your take on that?Caleb Maupin: This is just another example of the Western media creating a narrative. This is just a constant theme in the US press that somehow Russia is aggressive, that Russia is threatening the US. It is a constant theme but it\u2019s false. In fact it is the US that is escalating tensions with Russia. US troops and US military hardware are pouring into Eastern Europe; the US overthrew the democratically-elected government of Ukraine and replaced it with a virulently anti-Russian government. The US continues to fund anti-government forces in Syria, which is a country allied with Russia. So it is the US that is attacking Russia, and yet we get a barrage of media stories trying to make it as if it is the other way around and it is very disturbing. No evidence has been presented, and it really makes no sense: why would Russia be motivated to hack the computers of the US?RT:\u00a0The UK has also accused Russia of hacking into Snowden Files putting MI6 agents under threat. Back then there was no sufficient answer to the question of why Moscow was blamed.CM: Yes, why would any country seek a war with the US? The US has the biggest military budget of any country in the world; it plays a central role in the economy. Countries around the world do not want a confrontation with the US. It is the US that repeatedly forces the confrontation on any country that asserts its independence, whether that country is Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, China, or Russia. No matter what, if a country asserts their independence that is when the US enters a confrontation with them.The reality is that the US is engaging in cyber terrorism around the world, and that has been made blatantly apparent. Chinese computers and Chinese government computers frequently are hacked by the US. And Edward Snowden revealed that the US has a vast apparatus of cyber warfare that it has been engaging in around the world, but we never hear anything about that. But then these unsubstantiated claims against Russia, against China, show up in the media and it is supposed to justify further hostility and confrontation, when it is the US who is the source of aggression in all of these international situations.\n                   \u00a9 Pawel Kopczynski  / Reuters     \n                RT:\u00a0You mentioned that it was revealed by Edward Snowden that the NSA and GCHQ had hacked the Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab. How does that sit with US accusations of hacking by Russia?CM: Yes, even the most compliant US allies - like Germany and Poland - have been subjected to spying from the US with the cellphone calls and all kinds of private e-mails being recorded by the US. US leaders are really out of control: spying on people around the world, cyber hacking people around the world. But then every so often a story comes up and we are supposed to hate Russia here in the US, because Pentagon officials tell us that something has been hacked. Well, I don\u2019t trust the government in the US. And most people here in the US don\u2019t trust their government. If you look at the polls, people don\u2019t believe this - they know that the big oil companies, the owners of natural gas corporations here in the US, as the prices go down, they want to drive Russia out of international markets. They don\u2019t like having a competitor like Russia exporting oil and natural gas, and they are creating an international confrontation which is very dangerous.I think people in the US want peace with Russia and with every other country in the world.

In Crimea, the majority converse in Russian and their hearts have always beaten patriotically for the motherland. Crimea, after all, was part of Russia from 1784 until 1954, at which juncture Nikita Khrushchev, a native of Ukraine incidentally, made what some consider a major blunder: the Soviet leader gift-wrapped the peninsula and handed it over to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.Crimea is now part of Russia again, a fact that has vexed the West no end. The Western media vilifies President Putin for this affront and the neocons in Washington want his head on a platter. They drone on about a land-grab and the abrogation of international law. However, the Crimeans held a referendum and in a massive 80-percent turnout at the polls, some 96 percent voted to secede and rush back into the arms of Mother Russia, with the wolves of Kiev and their Western masters baying for blood at their heels. Instead, like a murder of crows, the pack descended on eastern Ukraine and picked it to pieces. I don't think Moscow could have rigged what was virtually a unanimous vote in Crimea, and in my view to call it a Kremlin heist is a gross distortion of the facts.Cool-hand Putin of course encouraged it all. He says his motive was to avoid the carnage and bloodshed that has tragically unfolded in eastern Ukraine. A French delegation of MPs, much to the chagrin of French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, visited the Crimea in late July to see for themselves how things are going on there. They were delighted to find that life is fine in the peninsula. \u201cCrimea is an absolutely peaceful region,\u201d said one of the French MPs on the fact-finding mission, Claude Goasguen. He went on to say, rather encouragingly from a Western politician: \u201cA parliamentarian in a democratic country and a democrat sees a major obligation in fighting misinformation, especially at the state level.\u201dOn the other hand, the population in the Donbass and Lugansk regions of eastern Ukraine has suffered terribly at the hands of their own people. The civil war has taken a devastating toll in human life, caused massive infrastructural damage and left the country at the mercy of internal thuggery and corruption. Ukraine\u2019s humanitarian crisis has reached epic proportions. There are now over a million displaced persons in Ukraine, and something approaching a million more frightened and desperate Ukrainians have fled to Russia. This puts the Russian Federation top of the current world list for asylum applications. Nobody in the West appears to bat an eyelid about this refugee crisis, preferring to persist in their favorite sport of Russia-bashing.It might occur to a casual bystander that the best solution would be to simply partition the country into an East and West Ukraine and have done with it. However, the thing to bear in mind about Ukraine is that all the country\u2019s wealth, its heavy industry, coalmines etc, is concentrated in the East. So naturally Kiev will fight like a rat in a corner and slaughter its own people to keep their mitts on the country\u2019s \u2018crown jewels\u2019. But the redoubtable folk in its eastern regions are hard as nails and are unlikely to capitulate.\n                   Members of the far-right radical group Right Sector and their supporters attend an anti-government rally in Kiev, Ukraine, July 21, 2015. \u00a9 Gleb Garanich / Reuters     \n                Ukraine is a disaster, a bankrupt nation run by crooks and hoodlums, in hock to another set of villains in the EU. It's little reported in the West, but now there are major ructions in the West of the country. The problem is Right Sector, which is basically a private army of Nazis who wield crippling power, attended by gangsterism, racketeering and violence. It was they who were in the vanguard of ousting Yanukovich in 2014 (a legally elected president), and now Right Sector is pushing to eject the current band of knaves and cutthroats holding court in Kiev. It\u2019s a real comedy of errors, except there is nothing much to laugh about. Any country that has a private army rampaging about is in for big trouble. If you lie down with dogs, you wake up with fleas, as the saying goes. Poroshenko and his ilk could well find themselves dragged out into the streets and shot without so much as a by your leave. Mr Poroshenko, an oligarch with a somewhat dubious and shady past, had better have his private jet standing by for a quick getaway.However, it might then be shot down and doubtless the blame would be laid on another \u2018Putin\u2019s missile\u2019 (headline courtesy of that bastion of balanced journalism \u2013 the Sun). In case you were unaware, according to the Sun it was \u2018Putin\u2019s missile\u2019 that shot down flight MH17 last July over Ukraine!The West has encouraged and in fact orchestrated the mayhem and madness in Ukraine. Millions of dollars were pumped in to fund NGOs, whose ulterior motive was to bring about regime change and create chaos on Russia\u2019s borders. And for their henchman they selected or at least condoned Nazi thugs such as Right Sector to do the dirty work. I find it ironic and sad in the extreme that our fathers and grandfathers fought a long and bitter WWII to rid the world of Nazism (helped out a great deal by Russia who lost something like 25 million souls in the effort), while today the West is turning a blind eye to its menace in Ukraine. And all in a sick and twisted geopolitical game.The good news is that NATO has blown Mission Ukraine. Despite all the sanctions and hoo-ha, it\u2019s hard to lend credence to the assertion that Russia is a threat and has designs on sweeping west to cut a red swathe through the heartlands of Europe. Nobody is really buying that particular brand of baloney. \u2018The Russians are coming\u2019 was always a rather empty and silly jest, anyway. On the other hand, NATO has swept east, despite the promise of Bush Sr to the Russians in the early 90s that they wouldn't. For heaven\u2019s sake, Russia is the biggest country in the world; it doesn't need to go rampaging about like a bear in a glass factory.The Baltic States and their pathetic whining about the \u2018Russian threat\u2019 are frankly a laughing stock. NATO generals and Western politicians maunder on about this ad nauseam too, but anyone with half a brain should be able to shred this tissue of lies into fragments and see it for what it is: a desperate and ill-judged move to demonize and ultimately unseat Putin in the old game of let\u2019s change the regime. Judging by opinion polls in Russia, the plan has backfired spectacularly. An overwhelming majority of the population approves of Vladimir Putin, and the chances of ousting him appear about as likely as installing a Communist Commander-in-Chief in the White House. Incidentally, China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, enjoys similar popularity at home.The Ukraine game is just one move in the grand geopolitical game of chess. The US is in check now, and checkmate could be just round the corner. I believe America has gone too far this time. Of course, no one can match the US for military power, but Moscow and Beijing have been bending like reeds in the wind, or in boxing parlance they have been biding their time, soaking up the punishment on the ropes. Are they getting ready to deliver a knockout blow?If you study the financial markets you can see strange things afoot. China dumped half a trillion dollars and Russia\u2019s dollar reserves are the lowest since the 1980s. Other countries such as Japan are also frantically ditching dollars. Switzerland has unpegged the Swiss franc from the euro; these and other intriguing signs suggest something is in the works. Some financial analysts are predicting that the Russia, BRICS, China axis is getting ready to wreak financial Armageddon on America. They are simply a tad cannier than the bullyboys in Washington. Putin is one hard, cool player and the Chinese... Well, you don't want to mess with them. Uncle Sam is, of course, far from being an idiot and Jade Helm (a little military exercise encompassing seven states and gargantuan amounts of firepower) looks like a prelude to martial law when the whole house of cards comes tumbling down.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.Steve Elliott, for RT", "articleHeader": "\n\n        What next after the neocon rape of Ukraine?\n\n     \n\n    ", "articleBiased": true, "articleUrl": "http://www.rt.com/op-edge/311635-ukraine-crimea-kiev-washington/", "articleSrc": "RT"}, {"articleText": "TrendsUkraine turmoilThe head of the Investigation Committee, Aleksandr Bastrykin, said in the Monday press release that the main objective of the project was to attract the attention of the international community and international Human Rights Group and to tell the truth about the \u201cterrible fratricidal war started by the nationalist regime of Ukraine.\u201dHe added that the Investigative Committee was looking into 54 criminal cases connected with the civil war in Ukraine and that the combined materials on these cases make 2,500 volumes, including the testimonies of over 100,000 witnesses.In the same release the agency elaborated that the White Book of Crimes was based on evidence collected by the Investigative Committee during the probes into cases where Ukrainian authorities and volunteers were suspected of using the banned methods of warfare. The evidence includes testimony of eyewitnesses and participants of these events, photos and various materials presented by international organizations.The document also reads that the agency continues the investigation into the suspected crimes committed on the territory of the neighboring state and that a special department has been created within the Investigative Committee for this purpose.Bastrykin wrote that the ultimate goal of the project was to ensure that all those involved in crimes receive the just punishment.The name of the law enforcers\u2019 report is apparently made similar to the document earlier released by the Russian Foreign Ministry.

The blacklist has been expanded to include new individuals and companies.READ MORE: US imposes further sanctions on Russia over Crimea, east Ukraine conflict RT: Mark Toner, State Department spokesperson, has said that these are not new sanctions, but strengthening of the existing sanctions. What do you make of that? Is that common practice?Gregory Copley: Not really is it such common practice. They are using the existing legislation and practice to strengthen the sanctions regime. It\u2019s no coincidence, however, as to the timing. The US worked very hard to get Russia aboard the P5+1 talks and an agreement with Iran. Now that that accord is in place with Iran, the US has begun to move to circumvent Iran and Iran\u2019s allies. They have now moved to work with Turkey for example on getting Turkey back into the military operations against Syria, and to upgrade US operations against Syria. They are moving to, in other words, to constrain Iran by those actions and Iran\u2019s allies and in this case it\u2019s Russia.So the US has introduced these sanctions or these additional sanctions literally as a follow-on to the post-Iran agreement, so they can now get back into the game of competing with Russia, competing with Iran. The State Department got what it wanted and President Obama got what he wanted by getting an agreement with Iran which is great for him domestically. But now he is moving back to support his old allies \u2013 Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the like \u2013 and to literally try and circumvent any Russian gains in the area.RT: These new sanctions come on the heels of yesterday's UN vote on a tribunal for MH17. The American embassy in Russia says these issues are not linked. Then why did they mention it?GC: I think the US expected Russia to veto that proposal so it was very much part of the process of renewed confrontation between Moscow and Washington or Washington and Moscow. Of course there is no suggestion that the US itself has to refrain from interference in Ukraine. The US has continued to escalate its provision of weapons to the western Ukraine government and has been providing a lot of agitation there leading up to the original Russian actions in Crimea for example.RT: Have sanctions proved effective so far? Are they having a desired effect on Russia?GC: There is no question that it\u2019s not helping the Russian economy. The Western media is quick to point out that the Russian economy grew only by 1.5 percent until recently and a flat couple of quarters since then, so clearly something is happening. But the same could be said for the US economy which is flat negative at this stage. The reality is that the sanctions are not helping anybody, quite the contrary they are also reinforcing the growing rift between the US and the EU; this is going to have a profound effect negatively both on the EU and the US in the near future. We see that the US and some European states are trying to strengthen or reposition NATO once again to give it a mission, and Ukraine is part of the perceived threat which has done that. But the reality is that NATO is split, Europe and the US are split, and this is only going to get worse the more that the US uses sanctions against Russia, which will have a very deleterious effect particularly on the European states.\n                   U.S. President Barack Obama \u00a9 Jonathan Ernst / Reuters     \n                RT: US Marines have recently arrived in Ukraine for military drills. Is this going to create more tension?GC: Of course it adds to tensions, it\u2019s designed to do so. It\u2019s designed to give President Obama the appearance that he is taking strong action and that he is a strong leader. In fact, the purpose and impact of these military deployments and the military aid to western Ukraine does not further US and Western strategic interests at this stage.During the Cold War, the big goal was to drive a rift between the Soviet Union and the People\u2019s Republic of China. That worked very successfully with Stalin and Nixon\u2019s visit to China and the gradual rift which we saw between the PRC and the Soviet Union. What the current US actions have done in Ukraine has been effectively to drive the Russian Federation back into the arms of People\u2019s Republic of China, creating a strategic block and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which is not necessarily helpful to the West at all.Sanctions \u2018astonishingly impotent\u2019 as foreign policy toolPatrick James, professor of International Relations at the University of Southern California, suggests that sanctions don\u2019t work in terms of affecting policy changes, as those who suffer from them are basically ordinary people and not those in insular elite positions in society.RT: The State Department says this is just a strengthening of the old sanctions, not the imposition of new ones. What's the difference?Patrick James: The difference that anyone outside of an expert could detect would be very minimal. What they are saying in the papers, and of course it is being reported very differently in various places, is that it is a continuation of policy. They are claiming it\u2019s not timed in any particular way as retaliation, but that isn\u2019t taken very seriously. My own view is someone who has studied sanctions extensively and even published research on it is that they are generally a tempest in a teapot. The attempts to coerce against Russia will have absolutely no impact whatsoever.READ MORE: West looks to close loopholes in anti-Russian sanctions \u2013 mediaThe reason it may be independently timed is that the President is not very well received right now across the board for the Iranian deal, and is in need for domestic political reasons for something that is a get-tough kind of movement. To be candid, since Russia is generally unpopular among Americans for the most part, it\u2019s a convenient type of target. I don\u2019t have any proof that what I\u2019m saying is correct, but it would fit the bill, namely that the President is being accused perhaps of being too accommodating toward Iran, which is seen as a Russian client, and now can look, if you will, like he is a tough guy coming after the Russian sponsors of Iran with these new sanctions.RT: The American embassy in Russia says the new restrictions are not linked to Wednesday's vote at the UN Security Council when Moscow vetoed the creation of an MH17 tribunal. Do you agree?PJ: It\u2019s so coincidental that occasionally these things can be that or, at the same time, it\u2019s linked. Now if I had to bet everything that I had on which way it goes, it is not a coincidence and it is linked, but it also could be independently explained by domestic political problems and perhaps the president thought he could get a two-for-one; that is, he could retaliate for what happened quite recently in a Russian context, but also gets some mileage out of counteracting the weak- willed image that he is accused of having at this point on the international stage because of the accommodations toward Iran. In other words, it could really be both things at once and it\u2019s hard to imagine there is no connection at all.RT: Have sanctions proved effective so far?PJ: Absolutely not. Sanctions - and much academic research on this subject bears out what I\u2019m about to say - are astonishingly impotent. They do not have the impact that is intended a lot of the time regrettably those who suffer from sanctions are people in society in weak positions, they do not affect or change the view of people in insular elite positions in society, and therefore they tend to have no impact or, even worse, they actually damage survivability, quality of life whatever you want to call it, of people in vulnerable positions while getting absolutely no policy changes that are desired.

No one has changed, primarily the government in Kiev; they have not changed their strategic aim nor have their sponsors. They want control over all of Ukraine and they get concessions where they have to, but fundamentally there is no goodwill to really come to a comprehensive agreement that will be agreed upon among all the parties. We just have this example of this latest constitutional amendment that\u2019s supposed to be going up before the Supreme Court in Ukraine: the representatives of Lugansk and Donetsk Republics were not included in this commission.

But then they do some shelling or they do something against the other side, and Kiev has deniability and that\u2019s just a recipe for more war. That reminds me very much of the situation in ex-Yugoslavia twenty years ago. We just had dozens of truces being achieved and yet they were just being used to buy time to rearm, to reorganize and just get ready for the next round of war.

What part can they play in destabilizing the whole process?AP: They can play a very large part and who is to say that this is not something that was agreed upon behind closed doors out of the public scene by Kiev and the so-called radical forces. It\u2019s just a good cop and a bad cop set-up, it very well could be. Let\u2019s take this thing seriously. Kiev has enough political clout, enough international support, enough arm power that if they wanted to squelch these extremist, radical forces they could. The fact that they haven\u2019t means that they really don\u2019t really have the will to do so and that\u2019s the main problem. Once again, intentions are not open, transparent and honest enough.

So if Kiev wants somebody to break the truce, to violate a peace agreement, Kiev can remain blameless if you can blame things on radicals that are not under its control. Like I said, it\u2019s a classical good cop \u2013 bad cop approach, but it\u2019s probably being coordinated at the very top because these radical forces are relatively small compared to what Kiev has at its disposal regarding military, security forces and international support.LISTEN MORE:The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.", "articleHeader": "\n\n        Right Sector:  Kiev playing good cop-bad cop against Ukrainian rebels\n\n     \n\n    ", "articleBiased": true, "articleUrl": "http://www.rt.com/op-edge/310258-ukraine-shelling-withdrawal-radicals/", "articleSrc": "RT"}, {"articleText": "TrendsUkraine turmoilThe amendments passed by lawmakers in the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada grant special status to the country\u2019s war-torn eastern regions, as is stipulated in the Minsk agreements.

Like a Sam\u2019s Choice Joe Goebbels, he\n  relentlessly beats a pro-Kiev drum while pasting a country he has\n  hardly ever been to and knows little about.\nBuzzfeed devotes huge resources to covering\n  Ukraine. Hence, I was hopeful they\u2019d have the inside track. Their\n  only recent reference to Mukachevo appears to be a description of\n  how its monasteries look like palaces. Meanwhile, Buzzfeed\u2019s\n  Kiev correspondent has this month published six stories\n  concerning Russia and nothing about Ukraine at all. This would be\n  the equivalent of covering the United Kingdom from Dublin.\n\n  Across established media, mention of the Mukachevo incident has\n  been muted. The New York Times buried it on page A9, for\n  instance. However, they did at least cover it. So too the Daily Telegraph of London, where Roland\n  Oliphant broke ranks with fellow hack-packers to pen a very good\n  summary. Even the Kyiv Post, hardly known for opposing right-wing\n  extremists in Ukraine, didn\u2019t run away from the story.\n\n  The real story\n\n  For the benefit of those who rely on American media for their\n  news, this is what happened in Mukachevo. On Saturday last, the\n  fascist Right Sector (\u2018Pravy Sektor\u2019) group, which played a\n  significant role in the Euromaidan coup last year, engaged in a\n  shoot-out with Ukrainian police. According to Anton Gerashchenko,\n  an adviser to Kiev\u2019s Interior Ministry, there were around 20\n  militia men, armed to the teeth, involved in the exchange.\n\n  The neo-Nazi organization claims that a local politician,\n  Mykhaylo Lanyo, ordered police to open fire on their members.\n  Right Sector further alleges that the \u2018volunteers\u2019 were merely\n  attending a meeting when they were set upon by blood-thirsty\n  cops. It is accepted that the fascists fired rocket-propelled\n  grenade launchers and Kalashnikov automatic rifles. Now, whatever\n  one may think of Ukraine\u2019s police, they are not noted for taking\n  a principled stand against hoodlums which have serious firepower\n  to hand. Additionally, if Right Sector were really interested in\n  curtailing smuggling, why would they hold secret meetings with\n  local mafia leaders?\n\n  Mustafa Nayyem, a Ukrainian MP and former journalist wrote on\n  his Facebook page that the real reason for the\n  violence was a dispute over the redistribution of the cigarette\n  smuggling business. Nayyem was in Mukacheve last week. The\n  Afghan-born Rada member\u2019s account seems the most plausible.\n\n  Let\u2019s be clear here. Lanyo is a gangster, like most regional\n  governors in Ukraine. The Right Sector is also a bunch of\n  gangsters, masquerading as patriots. Meanwhile, the government in\n  Kiev is also, predominantly, a skulk of thieves. All Maidan\n  achieved was to replace one cabal of crooks with another. This is\n  the reality and no amount of Western media whitewashing can alter\n  this fact.\n\n  When the Right Sector was doing NATO\u2019s bidding in helping to\n  overthrow the elected, albeit horrible, Yanukovich government in\n  Kiev, their extremism was ignored by the EU and US press. Now the\n  same outlets are probably too embarrassed to expose the group's\n  modus operandi.\n\n  For example, on Monday night, the organization\u2019s former Rada\n  candidate, Oleh Kutserib, attended a rally in Kiev, in support of\n  his fellow Nazis. On the way home, he beat up two gay men and\n  then bragged about it on Facebook. I am indebted to the\n  courageous Ukrainian journalist Maxim Eristavi for highlighting\n  this and linking to the offending post. Eristavi, a co-founder of\n  the US embassy-funded Hromadske TV, has been one of the few\n  Maidan cheerleaders honest enough to admit the true colors of\n  some of its protagonists.\n\n  No smoke without fire\n\n  Reaction in Kiev government circles to the Mukachevo shoot-out\n  has been mixed. Of course, these extremists that overthrew\n  Yanukovich and current President Petro Poroshenko know only too\n  well that they could repeat the trick and topple his regime.\n  Naturally a government which relies on private militias to\n  perform army duties is completely impotent when faced with the\n  gang threat. This brings to mind the old dictum, \u201clie down\n  with the dogs and wake up with the fleas.\u201d\n  Anyway, there is little doubt the weekend\u2019s events were somehow\n  related to contraband. The south-west Ukrainian region of\n  Zakarpattia is renowned for being a hot bed of smuggling\n  activity, which is the lifeblood of western Ukraine. Anybody who\n  has ever crossed the Ukrainian/EU frontier at Chop (Hungary) or\n  Medyka (Poland) can attest to this.\n\n  At the Polish border town of Medyka the practice looks,\n  outwardly, more sad than sinister. All day, lines upon lines of\n  Ukrainians wait to enter Poland, ferrying cigarettes and vodka.\n  It\u2019s reportedly a lucrative business: a legal pack of cigarettes\n  in Ukraine costs \u20ac0.94, compared to around \u20ac7 in France, where\n  many of the smuggled \u2018cancer-sticks\u2019 end up. On the\n  return trip, Medyka\u2019s smugglers bring meat which is, somewhat\n  bizarrely, cheaper in Poland than Ukraine. Border guards on both\n  sides either turn a blind eye or are, more likely, paid to do so.\n  Occasionally the Polish make a few \u2018raids,\u2019 one presumes\n  to satisfy some kind of EU quota.\n\n  At Chop, in the same region as the weekend\u2019s ISIS-style gun\n  fight, it\u2019s a lot more aggressive. One noted local scam is\n  related to car license plates. While your car is\n  \u2018checked,\u2019 local customs remove the plates and insist\n  you go to the local police station to get them back. Once there,\n  it costs \u20ac50 to release them. In 2010, the room contained\n  hundreds of them, mostly Slovakian and Hungarian.\n\n  I personally encountered the reality of Ukrainian corruption in\n  Chop, back in 2011. Upon arriving from Lviv, I had a one-hour\n  wait for a train to make the five minute passage to the next\n  Hungarian station. A \u2018friendly\u2019 Ukrainian border control\n  operative accosted me and insisted I take a \u20ac25 taxi ride to the\n  frontier with a \u2018taxi driver.\u2019 Eventually, he claimed\n  that the train was cancelled, even though the notice board\n  clearly said it was due. When I repeatedly refused, the officer\n  grabbed my passport for \u2018stamping\u2019 and when he returned\n  it; the plastic on the information page had been lifted off,\n  rendering it invalid. The train arrived a few minutes later and\n  the Hungarian authorities met my problem with a resigned shrug -\n  they said it happened every day.\n\n  Fast forward to today and far-right thugs are seeking control of\n  the lucrative cigarette smuggling business on the frontier. Right\n  Sector is essentially Ukraine's largest private army, boasting\n  10,000 armed members. In recent weeks the group has intensified\n  its anti-Kiev rhetoric in Mukachevo, labeling the government\n  \"an inner occupying force\" and suggesting it should be\n  overthrown.\n\n  Not long ago, the US propaganda outlet VOA interviewed the faux\n  patriot\u2019s spokesman Artem Skoropadsky and he said: \"If\n  there's a new revolution, Ukraine's President Poroshenko and his\n  teammates won't be able to make it out of the country the way the\n  previous president did. They can't expect anything other than an\n  execution in some dark vault, carried out by a group of young\n  officers of Ukraine's army and National Guard.\u201d Skoropadsky\n  also said that another coup is inevitable if the government\n  refuses to acquiesce to Right Sector demands.\n\n  The Ukrainian civil war has moved west. Whereas the eastern\n  rebels and gangsters are \u2018only\u2019 seeking to secede from\n  Kiev, their western brethren wish to take over the entire country\n  and control all its criminal levers.

And we have seen a very important fall in amount of fighting and violence in eastern Ukraine. The second point is why it is damaging to the West, particularly Germany, which has a major involvement, but also Britain, where, you know, for instance, Russia has got involvement in the city of London. They do not seem to be putting those economic considerations ahead, at the top of agenda. Could it be that they are bowing to the American pressure on this? I think, largely, it is. But, secondly, as well, I think there is a point here that the West has got itself into a pickle over the way it portrays and it is almost accepting this idea that the Putin regime is on the par with the country like North Korea, one of the worst dictatorships since Saddam\u2019s in Iraq. And it is clearly not the case. And most authorities in the West on Russia would turn around and say \u2026the way the West is reacting to Russia and portraying Russia is frankly ludicrous.

He was referring to the Maidan uprising and subsequent violent coup in February 2014, which brought down the previous president and government. Monday's events were, according to the former prime minister, a logical result of the West\u2019s policies.Azarov also believes the clashes, which started after a decentralization bill was approved by parliament, could have been a provocation by the government itself, aimed at demonstrating\u00a0that even a small concession to the rebels can cause an escalation of violence.#Ukraine's far-right Radical Party leader leaves coalition, switches to opposition http://t.co/gCzNvXUyB7pic.twitter.com/ORIfwkYArS\u2014 RT (@RT_com) September 1, 2015Even the approved constitutional amendments will not actually lead to a decentralization of power, Azarov says. On the contrary, by allowing the president to put his prefects in all Ukraine's regions, it will give Poroshenko more power. It also provides the president with the ability to revoke any decision and to remove any civil servant in local authorities.\u201cIs it decentralization? Decentralization is granting more power to regions,\u201d Azarov said, adding that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics will most likely reject the proposals, thus giving Poroshenko an excuse to accuse them of violating the Minsk peace agreements.READ MORE: \u2018Right wing practicing violence in Ukraine no mystery to anyone\u2019Nikolai Azarov was Ukraine's prime minister from 2010 to 2014.

There\n  hasn\u2019t been five minutes this past week when some news channel\n  hasn\u2019t managed to produce a starving pensioner or despairing\n  youth to illustrate how miserable Greek life is. However, there\u2019s\n  another European country where existence is even grimmer -\n  Ukraine. Despite this, much of the same media presents the war\n  torn country as a positive example of Western intervention.\n\n  Nevertheless, the fact remains that Ukraine\u2019s economy atrophied by 28 percent in 2014. From a nominal GDP\n  of $182 billion (1.566 trillion hryvnia at 8.1 to $1) to one of\n  $62 billion (1.465 trillion hryvnia), when adjusted for the\n  collapse of the hryvnia currency. In 2013, the average wage was\n  already a pitiful $410 a month under the democratically elected -\n  but horrid - Viktor Yanukovich government. Now, after the\n  Washington and Brussels-backed Maidan coup, it sits at $184\n  monthly. This makes me very sad and angry. For the simple reason\n  that I like Ukraine, very much.\nREAD MORE: Thousands of Ukrainian citizens to sue\n  Kiev regime over human rights violations \u2013 Russian activists\n  Here are a few more catastrophic and depressing economic figures\n  to further dampen the mood. Since the coup, new car purchases\n  have decreased by 76 percent and vehicle production by a whopping\n  93 percent. Steel production has recoiled by a third. Meanwhile,\n  gasoline sales are down by 40 percent. Additionally, inflation\n  (officially) has increased by 61percent, year on year (April\n  2014-April 2015).\n\n  For far too long, those of us with a genuine affection for\n  Ukraine have allowed anti-Russia activists and Western media\n  chancers to hijack debate about the country. Many actual Ukraine\n  experts understood clearly that the Maidan movement was going to\n  end in disaster and took this unpopular - in the West - view from\n  the very start. Instead of being listened to, these sensible\n  voices were branded as \u201cPutin stooges\u201d and \u201cUkraine\n  haters\u201d by people with hardly any credentials to comment on\n  the situation at all. Indeed, quite a few hacks that landed in\n  Kiev early last year, pushing a pro-NATO/EU line, are now in\n  Greece playing the exact same trick. Actually, some previously\n  pulled the same stunt in Syria and Iran.\n\n  Ukraine - truths and distortions\n\n  What actually happened at \u2018Euromaidan\u2019 is rather different from\n  how the Western media has reported the story. The collective line\n  is that a \u2018revolution of dignity\u2019 overthrew a horrible regime and\n  immediately began transforming the country into a modern\n  progressive democracy. This agenda is served by countless\n  compositions extolling the virtues of the post-coup leaders.\n  These read more like puff PR than serious news analysis. Here\u2019s a\n  really good example from The Financial Times this\n  week. Read it and ask yourself how much a local advert rag would\n  charge for such a loving write-up? Yet the FT is held up as a\n  paragon of journalistic virtue by Western think-tanks and\n  educational institutions.\n\n  All this reportage is total codswallop, and usually written to\n  order by eager-to-please stringers desperate to either revive\n  flagging careers or kick start nascent paths in journalism.\n  Sometimes they don\u2019t even need the template actually spelled out\n  to them because the rules are obvious. We all know that anybody\n  remotely seen as being sympathetic to the Russian point of view\n  simply cannot get published in almost all Western mainstream\n  media these days. Hence, for a young hack eager to prosper, the\n  obvious path is being as anti-Russian as possible.\n\n  Anyway, what really happened in Kiev is that the \u201cEuromaidan\u201d\n  episode didn\u2019t herald a new dawn for principled democracy in\n  Ukraine. It merely replaced one corrupt gang of oligarchic\n  leeches with another. Now Ukraine has the richest head of state\n  in Europe, the billionaire Petro Poroshenko, while paying its\n  pensioners \u00a35 a week. Ukraine makes Greece look like Narnia.\n\n  What you will never read in the Western press, by the way, is\n  that the same Poroshenko served as Minister for Trade in\n  Yanukovich\u2019s government until December 2012. The same \u2018regime\u2019\n  that delivered average salaries over double what Poroshenko\u2019s\n  \u2018modernizing government\u2019 currently manages. Last year, he\n  sponsored a \u2018lustration\u2019 law, aimed at purging members of\n  Yanukovich\u2019s administration from state governance. People just\n  like himself.\n\n  Poroshenko's mendacity\n\n  As the Canadian writer Halyna Mokrushnyna pointed out in an\n  essential piece last week, there is also the\n  issue of Poroshenko\u2019s serial fibbing. \u201cLies about a promised\n  visa-free regime to Europe that has \"acquired a fixed place in\n  the calendar for the first time,\u201d Poroshenko says in his\n  speech, in spite of public statements of European officials\n  saying that they cannot name a date for the introduction of\n  visa-free entry to Europe for Ukrainians. Lies about plans to\n  hold a referendum on Ukraine's joining NATO, which \"we would\n  have easily won,\u201d but will not held because \"this issue\n  will shake the country\" and its unity. \"So is Ukraine\n  united in this issue or no, Mr. President?\u201d Mokrushnyna\n  asked.\n\n  The Russian domestic press often features must-read analysis of\n  Ukraine, but obvious issues with language prevent it being widely\n  read in the West. Thus, I feel obliged to select some points from\n  this marvelous Korrespondent article from Yuri Lukashin.\n  Lukashin asserts that Ukraine is now \"a banana republic\n  without bananas.\" Furthermore, he insists that the nation is\n  committing suicide. There is plenty of logic in his reasoning.\n\n  Ukraine\u2019s income levels were already pathetic by European\n  standards under the previous set of \u2018kleptocratic\u2019 leaders. Under\n  the new gang of (Washington-approved) thieves, salaries are now\n  pretty horrendous even by African measures. Yet, Western hacks\n  continue to peddle the complete nonsense that Ukraine is changing\n  for the better. Kiev\u2019s tightly-controlled media bangs the same\n  drum. Meanwhile, anybody capable of rational thought must surely\n  be starting to realize that Ukraine is behaving, more and more,\n  like the world\u2019s largest, open-air, lunatic\u2019s asylum.\n\n  Lukashin writes: \u201cIn the year following the great \"revolution\n  of dignity,\u201d Ukraine has been successful in building towards a\n  specific type of economy, mostly similar to that of a \"banana\n  republic.\u201d In fact, there is only one difference between\n  Ukraine\u2019s current path and its banana brethren in faraway Africa,\n  Latin America, and Asia. That is complete lack of bananas.\n  \u201cThere are numerous reasons why the EU - and the West in\n  general - do not need Ukraine in its current form. It simply\n  doesn't fit the EU's political, economic, or cultural framework.\n  If it did, Ukraine would have successfully integrated already in\n  the previous 24 years it has tried to. If it did, the EU wouldn't\n  allow Ukrainian standards of living drop to African levels after\n  the \"pro-European\" violent takeover. Ukraine would enjoy the open\n  borders, economic benefits, and other hallmarks of European\n  acceptance it thought it would receive shortly after \"choosing\n  Europe,\u201d he adds.\n\n  Pray for Ukraine\n\n  Of course, there is a question never asked by Western supporters\n  of Ukraine\u2019s \u201cEuropean choice.\u201d What exact role would Ukraine\n  fulfill in the EU, if it ever were allowed to join? While I\n  accept that the very thought is ludicrous, many frequently\n  embellish and claim that Kiev will eventually accede to the EU.\n  Brussels is incapable of saving Greece, so how would it finance a\n  decrepit state which makes Greece look like Switzerland? Also,\n  how would the British people react to 45 million (extremely poor)\n  Ukrainians gaining access to the UK labor market - and, more\n  importantly, its welfare system?\n\u201cUkraine was built for a different economic model, with\n  different markets and economic partners in mind. Specifically,\n  the giant Russian market, which supported Ukraine through\n  mutually beneficial trade, huge fossil fuel discounts, and\n  Soviet-era economic connections. Cooperation with Russia kept\n  Ukraine afloat until now and even provided an economic base\n  which, as it turned out, allowed the country to grow a sizable\n  population of hipsters and office workers that forgot why they\n  needed all this unfashionable and smelly industry,\u201d argues\n  Lukashin.\n\n  Amid all this, the next economic \u2018challenge\u2019 facing Ukraine\u2019s\n  embattled citizens is new \u2018European-style\u2019 utility bills due to\n  land in the coming weeks. Charges will be doubled, with a further\n  40 percent increase slated for the autumn. These new prices\n  create the very real possibility that utility charges could\n  exceed pensions. A potential humanitarian disaster is possible in\n  winter.\n\n  Lukashin concludes with these pertinent words, \u201cThe social\n  and economic catastrophe that the country keeps sliding towards\n  is, to large extent, the consequence of our citizens\u2019 support of\n  the governments that got them there, the political ideals they\n  worshipped, as well as Ukrainians believing that everybody else\n  owes them something. The USA owes them because Ukraine is\n  supposedly fighting Russia. Europe, because Ukraine supposedly\n  protects it from Russia's supposed aggression and Russia, simply\n  because Ukrainians are so wise and great that Russians should\n  naturally admire and serve them.\u201d\n  During the initial Euromaidan protests and subsequent coup, many\n  Ukrainians changed their social media profile pictures to an English\n  language graphic, titled \u201cPray for Ukraine.\u201d While\n  things were far from perfect then, the real suffering had yet to\n  start.\nThe time to\u201cPray for Ukraine\u201dis now.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.", "articleHeader": "\n\n        \u200bUkraine - a \u2019Banana Republic\u2019 without bananas\n\n     \n\n    ", "articleBiased": true, "articleUrl": "http://rt.com/op-edge/272986-ukraine-crisis-conflict-maidan/", "articleSrc": "RT"}]
