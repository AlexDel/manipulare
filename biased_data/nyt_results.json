As the Russian Foreign Ministry appears to be moving toward recognizing the results of the voting, which was dismissed by the United States as a \u201csham,\u201d Western officials are increasingly concerned that the Kremlin may be taking the steps necessary to establish an enclave that remains outside Kiev\u2019s control. During a visit to the Pentagon, the commander, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, echoed those worries, telling reporters that \u201cI am concerned that the conditions are there that could create a frozen conflict.\u201d Moscow followed that blueprint after the war with Georgia in 2008, establishing enclaves in Abkhazia and South Ossetia to ensure that the territorially compromised nation could not join NATO. It did the same earlier with Transnistria, a breakaway territory of Moldova where Russians have been stationed. The concern now is that a buffer zone between Ukrainian and separatist forces, established as part of a September cease-fire, may become a de facto border of the new enclave. Meanwhile, the border between eastern Ukraine and Russia has remained open. \u201cWe have seen a general trend towards a hardening of this line of demarcation and much more softening of the actual Ukraine-Russia border,\u201d General Breedlove said. \u201cThe Ukraine-Russia border is wide open,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is completely porous. Russian equipment, resupply, training flows back and forth freely.\u201d Though the Kremlin has denied that it has sent forces into Ukraine, General Breedlove said about 250 to 300 Russian soldiers are still in the country. \u201cThese are not fighting formations,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are formations and specialists who are in there doing training and equipping of the separatist forces.\u201d And as the Sunday vote approached, he reported, some Russian military units edged closer to Russia\u2019s border with Ukraine, an intimidating move that appeared intended to caution the Ukrainian government not to intervene. \u201cSome of those formations have moved closer to the border,\u201d General Breedlove said. \u201cWe believe that was probably to bring some pressure on and make sure that the elections went according to the separatists\u2019 plans.\u201d On Saturday, in another show of force, a column of about 60 unmarked military trucks drove through Donetsk. In total, Russia has seven battalions near Ukraine, down from the 18 battalions \u2014 about 20,000 troops \u2014 it had there in August. But the forces are enough to maintain Russia\u2019s influence in the area and to buttress Moscow\u2019s efforts to help the separatists. On Monday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported that pro-Russian fighters had fired on one of its surveillance drones the day before as it was filming pro-Russian forces on the move near a Ukrainian checkpoint. \u201cNew drones under fire east of the contact line,\u201d the group said in a post on Twitter. The organization issued a statement saying the drone was flying at an altitude of about 5,000 feet near Mariupol, in the south of the Donetsk region, on the pro-Russian side of the front. It was filming a civilian truck when \u201ca canvas covering on the back of the truck was removed, revealing a truck-mounted antiaircraft gun, which immediately fired numerous rounds\u201d at the drone but missed. Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, has said he does not want a crystallization of the status quo into a frozen conflict, but the Russian Foreign Ministry nevertheless issued a statement saying it would respect the outcome of separatist elections. Russia \u201crespects the choice made by residents of the southeast\u201d of Ukraine, Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Grigory Karasin, later told the Interfax news agency. \u201cOur position is that the elected representatives of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions thereby received a mandate to hold negotiations with the central Ukrainian authorities and, acting as part of their political dialogue, tackle all the problems that have accumulated over many months,\u201d Mr. Karasin said. The ministry statement stopped short of recognizing the outcome of the vote, but still drew a din of criticism from European officials. Steffen Seibert, the spokesman for Germany\u2019s chancellor, Angela Merkel, told reporters in Berlin that it was \u201cincomprehensible that there are official Russian voices that are respecting or even recognizing these so-called elections.\u201d The turn of events in the rebellious territories ruled out any early lifting of European sanctions imposed on Russia and could lead to further sanctions if security deteriorated, Mr. Seibert said. The European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said in a statement, \u201cI consider today\u2019s \u2018presidential and parliamentary elections\u2019 in Donetsk and Luhansk \u2018People\u2019s Republics\u2019 a new obstacle on the path toward peace.\u201d The Ukrainian government has refused to negotiate directly with the rebel leadership outside of the O.S.C.E.-brokered cease-fire talks that include European and Russian officials, and it calls the separatist leadership \u201cterrorists.\u201d President Petro O. Poroshenko described Sunday\u2019s elections as a farce. The rebel central election committee in Donetsk said Aleksandr Zakharchenko, a former electrician, had won the election with about 78 percent of the vote. Mr. Zakharchenko commanded a pro-Russian militia, Oplot, until August, when the Donetsk Supreme Soviet elevated him to prime minister, replacing a Russian citizen in a leadership shuffle intended to put a local face on the movement. Mr. Zakharchenko is a Russian-speaking ethnic Ukrainian. In Luhansk, election officials said Igor Plotnitsky, a former public health inspector, had won with about 63 percent of the vote. The elections in both regions offered few plausible alternatives, and separatist officials said the purpose of the voting was to legitimize the leadership and compel Kiev to negotiate with them.", "articleHeader": "Russia Continues to Train and Equip Ukraine Rebels, NATO Official Says "}, {"articleBiased": true, "articleUrl": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/20/world/europe/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-sending-more-troops-and-artillery-to-aid-rebels.html?ref=world", "articleSrc": "NYT", "articleText": " MOSCOW \u2014  In as clear a sign as any of the unraveling peace process in eastern Ukraine, the authorities in Kiev accused Russia on Monday of again sending regular army soldiers into Ukraine to prop up pro-Russian separatists who were losing a battle. About 700 soldiers crossed Russia\u2019s western border into the snowy war zone in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council said in a statement that was not possible to verify independently. They came armed with a wide array of heavy weapons, Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk told journalists in Kiev, the capital. The country\u2019s intelligence agencies \u201cconfirm that men and equipment entered from Russia,\u201d he said. Howitzers and other artillery and antiaircraft systems were said to have crossed the border. \u201cThese items cannot be bought in a market in Donetsk or the Russian Federation,\u201d Mr. Yatsenyuk said. \u201cThey can only come from the stock of the Russian Defense Ministry.\u201d The accusation followed a weekend of escalating and bloody mayhem alarming even by the standards of eastern Ukraine. After first being partly pushed from the ruins of the main terminal of the Donetsk airport last week, the Ukrainian military counterattacked with tanks over the weekend and claimed to have recaptured all the lost ground. At least four Ukrainian soldiers were killed and scores wounded in the fighting, and human rights groups in Donetsk were investigating reports that up to 10 civilians had been killed by stray shells. Beyond the immediate conflict zone, an explosion outside a courthouse in Kharkiv, another eastern city, wounded 12 people in the latest in a string of politically hued bombings and assassinations in eastern Ukraine that the authorities have labeled terrorist acts. Bombs have detonated in centers where volunteers collect goods for the army, in bars frequented by activists who support Ukraine\u2019s government and outside hospitals treating wounded soldiers. On Sunday, an unexplained explosion destroyed nine parked cars in a district of Kiev. Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry accused Ukraine on Monday of making a disingenuous offer to reinstate the cease-fire negotiated on Sept. 5. The ministry said the authorities in Kiev had first ignored peace overtures in a letter from President Vladimir V. Putin that was sent late last week. Ukraine\u2019s president, Petro O. Poroshenko, proposed an immediate recommitment to a cease-fire in the east. \u201cUkraine is ready to sign a cease-fire agreement if the sides stick to the Minsk accords,\u201d he said, referring to the talks in Belarus that led to the cease-fire. \u201cUkraine wants peace.\u201d Both sides in the conflict concede that what they are now fighting over is chiefly a symbol, and a battered, ugly one at that: the ruins of the airport. For the Ukrainians, the airport forms the army\u2019s toehold in the rebel capital city, Donetsk, illustrating to residents there that a breakaway region will never really be viable or independent. For Russia, the continual rebel efforts to seize the ruins achieve substantially the same goal: highlighting the perpetual state of insecurity Ukraine will live in, so long as Russia\u2019s interests are not reckoned with. Russia\u2019s Foreign Ministry issued a statement over the weekend saying Ukraine should voluntarily hand over the airport to separatist control. European foreign ministers meeting Monday opted to keep economic sanctions against Russia in place, despite suggestions in an internal European Union policy document leaked last week that European nations should seek to revive some cooperation with Russia. Fighters with the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, one of the separatist forces, seized control of the airport\u2019s runway and taxiways last week, according to Ukrainian accounts, while the terminal buildings were the setting of bitter, close combat. Pro-Russian groups controlled the second floor and above in the main terminal building, while the Ukrainian forces held lower floors and access tunnels. Stairwells and even holes in the floors became front lines. In the tank assault on Sunday, Ukraine\u2019s army claimed to have expelled the separatists from the runway, allowing the army to move new forces into the terminal and evacuate casualties. That success soon led to a reversal. Ukrainian and separatist authorities both reported Monday that the separatists had collapsed the second floor in an explosion, wounding or killing an unknown number of Ukrainians below. Yuri Biryukov, an adviser to Mr. Poroshenko, wrote on Facebook that \u201cthe debris fell on the fighters\u201d and that \u201cthere are many wounded.\u201d Despite the Ukrainian claims, there was no indication on Monday that newly arrived Russian forces were involved in the battle for the airport.", "articleHeader": "Ukraine Accuses Russia of Sending More Troops and Artillery to Aid Rebels "}, {"articleBiased": true, "articleUrl": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/opinion/vladimir-putin-hides-the-truth.html?_r=0", "articleSrc": "NYT", "articleText": " For President Vladimir Putin of Russia, the manipulation and suppression of facts is as much a tool of his war in Ukraine as an AK-47 or a rocket launcher. He continues to insist that Russian soldiers and weapons are not involved in the conflict in the eastern sector of the country, despite evidence to the contrary from NATO, the United States and independent journalists. Last week Mr. Putin added a new and especially cruel twist to his formula of deception by decreeing that the deaths or wounds of Russian soldiers in \u201cspecial operations\u201d can be classified as military secrets, even in peacetime. In the past, the list of state secrets applied only to personnel losses in wartime. The decree furthers a climate of propaganda and secrecy that was well established during Soviet times and that Mr. Putin has worked hard to revive. It could lead to the arrest of journalists and human rights activists who gather and publicize information about soldiers\u2019 deaths, further restricting the open flow of essential information. On a personal level, the decree is especially heartless because it could make it even more difficult for loved ones to obtain the facts about their soldiers\u2019 deaths or injuries, which grieving families need to understand the circumstances of the casualties. Government critics also charge that Russia\u2019s refusal to acknowledge that its soldiers are in combat denies them disability payments and their relatives death benefits and other awards. Mr. Putin clearly fears a political backlash from Russians who could turn against him and his destructive policies if they learn the truth about Ukraine. Public opinion polls have largely shown that Russian support for Mr. Putin is high and many Russians don\u2019t believe their military forces are involved in Ukraine. But that could change. A recent report by members of Russia\u2019s political opposition said that at least 220 active-duty Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since last spring. And there are signs that the toll is rising, including wounded troops showing up at hospitals, new graves appearing in cemeteries, dozens of military funerals during the past year and testimony from relatives of the dead, The Times reported. Some analysts suspect the new decree may also be a sign that Mr. Putin is gearing up for another military push in Ukraine, when the casualty numbers could be even higher. Regardless of the executive order, Russians have access to the Internet and even in villages, information gets through. Mr. Putin may not be able to count on the complicity of his citizens if more young men come home in body bags.", "articleHeader": "Vladimir Putin Hides the Truth"}, {"articleBiased": true, "articleUrl": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/07/business/international/in-ukraine-crisis-us-businesses-face-tit-for-tat-response-to-sanctions.html?_r=0", "articleSrc": "NYT", "articleText": " MOSCOW \u2014 The scene was straight out of \u201cC.S.I.,\u201d food safety edition.

Russia has long dismissed Western allegations that its military has intervened in Ukraine as little more than computer-generated propaganda. In an attempt to puncture the Russian denials, independent experts have operated like digital Sherlock Holmeses, using Google\u2019s Street View, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, satellite photographs and Russia\u2019s version of Facebook, including social media updates by Russian soldiers. That research was then supplemented by more traditional sources like court documents and local media reports. \u201cIndependent researchers, using open sources and rigorous methodology, have demonstrated that Russian troops and Russian weapons have been an important part of the fight in Ukraine\u2019s east,\u201d said John E. Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine and one of the authors of the report, Hiding in Plain Sight: Putin\u2019s War in Ukraine, which is to be released Thursday by the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based research center. While the most recent photograph analyzed in the Atlantic Council report was taken in February, Jens Stoltenberg, NATO\u2019s secretary general, said in an interview in Washington on Wednesday that there was ample evidence that Russia still had forces in Ukraine and was sending arms to separatists there. \u201cRussia is present in eastern Ukraine,\u201d Mr. Stoltenberg said. \u201cThis is something we have from our own intelligence. But in addition to our own intelligence, it is based on open sources.\u201d The report comes as European nations are preparing to vote next month on whether to ease or maintain economic sanctions on Russia because of its role in Ukraine. \u201cThe way Russian propaganda works, it makes it seem you can\u2019t possibly know the truth,\u201d said Eliot Higgins, a British-based researcher who founded the investigative website Bellingcat.com and led the effort to analyze the imagery for the Atlantic Council report. \u201cIf you try to counter it by doing the same thing, you are just adding to the noise. But you can get to the truth by pointing to the open source data and what\u2019s publicly available.\u201d Analyzing photographs of large craters in Ukraine and videos of rocket launches on nearby Russian territory, the Atlantic Council report concludes that Russian units have fired across the Ukrainian border. The report finds that craters near the Ukrainian town Panchenkove were the result of Russian multiple rocket fire near Gukovo, Russia, and from a separate site in eastern Ukraine. \u201cFour videos containing geotags filmed in different locations in and around Gukovo showed the launch of rockets,\u201d the report said. \u201cCross-border attacks served as cover for a renewed military incursion in the summer of 2014.\u201d Geotags can show where images and videos were created. Drawing on satellite photographs and social media posts by Russian soldiers, the report shows the network of Russian military camps that have sprouted near the Ukrainian border and have been used to send Russian weapons and troops into eastern Ukraine. The camps, the report notes, are in plain view to \u201canyone with access to Google Earth or Google Maps.\u201d Using YouTube video, the report tracked the movement of Russian convoys, including armored vehicles and self-propelled artillery. In one case, the report notes, a Russian military convoy was filmed moving in August through Staraya Stanitsa, Russia. In February, a YouTube channel associated with Russian-backed Ukrainian separatists showed an armored vehicle from the same convoy in Ukraine. By using satellite imagery and separate photographs of Russian equipment, the report also documents the movement of Russian tanks, SA-22 air-defense systems, Grad rocket launchers and armored reconnaissance vehicles. American officials have at times used photographs to buttress their claims of Russian intervention. When Secretary of State John Kerry met with President Vladimir V. Putin in Sochi, Russia, this month, Mr. Kerry showed him photographs of Russian air defenses and other weapons in eastern Ukraine to try to persuade him that the United States had clear evidence of Russia\u2019s military role, Western officials said. Last year, NATO also issued satellite photographs of Russian artillery positions inside Ukraine to support its allegations of Russian involvement. But the photographs Mr. Kerry showed Mr. Putin have not been made public. Russian officials, who have repeatedly portrayed Ukraine\u2019s new government as the main obstacle to a political settlement, have dismissed NATO\u2019s public evidence as misinformation. Mr. Stoltenberg declined to say how many Russian troops were in Ukraine or positioned near its border. But one Western official, who asked not to be identified because he was discussing intelligence reports, said Russia had moved about nine battalion tactical groups close to its border with Ukraine, and that as many as five additional battalions could be sent there in coming weeks. The number of troops in such units can vary, but a battalion could have about 1,000 troops, creating a potential force of well over 10,000 Russian troops in Ukraine by this summer. It is unclear if Russia is preparing for a major offensive to help Ukrainian separatists seize more territory or if it is trying to put pressure on the Ukrainian government to make more constitutional concessions. Either way, the moves by Russia\u2019s military are a violation of the peace agreement that was negotiated in Minsk, Belarus, in February, which called for the removal of foreign troops, the pulling back of heavy weapons and the disbanding of \u201cillegal groups.\u201d Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in a speech on Wednesday that the conflict over Ukraine is \u201ca test for the West,\u201d and that \u201cPresident Putin is wagering that he has greater staying power.\u201d", "articleHeader": "Armed With Google and YouTube, Analysts Gauge Russia\u2019s Presence in Ukraine"}, {"articleBiased": true, "articleUrl": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/08/world/europe/ukraine-accuses-russia-of-sending-tanks-and-troops-across-border.html?_r=0", "articleSrc": "NYT", "articleText": " MOSCOW \u2014  Ukraine accused Russia on Friday of dispatching tanks, troops and other weaponry across the border to bolster separatists who control a small eastern portion of Ukraine, the latest in a series of charges and countercharges that are gradually undermining a tenuous peace plan signed two months ago. Speaking in Kiev, the capital, Col. Andriy Lysenko, a Ukrainian military spokesman, said 32 tanks, 16 howitzers and 30 trucks hauling ammunition and fighters had crossed into the Luhansk region from Russia. He presented no clear evidence to support the claim, nor did the wealth of social media outlets in eastern Ukraine display any footage of a tank convoy. The Kiev government frequently made such claims that could not be substantiated during intense fighting between Ukrainian government troops and separatists earlier this year. Neither NATO nor the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is monitoring a cease-fire, could confirm the report. NATO issued a statement in Brussels saying it had noticed increased military activity along the frontier. \u201cWe can confirm a recent increase in Russian troops and equipment along the eastern border of Ukraine,\u201d the statement said. \u201cRussia continues to demonstrate its lack of regard for international agreements and its determination to further destabilize Ukraine.\u201d The Ukrainian military issued a separate statement saying it had killed up to 200 rebel fighters, and destroyed a variety of military equipment, in the  continuing battle \nover the airport outside Donetsk, which Ukrainian government forces control. Andrei Purgin, the deputy prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic, accused the government forces of starting an \u201call-out war\u201d against the separatist fighters, according to a report from Russia\u2019s state-controlled RIA Novosti news agency on Thursday. More than 4,000 people have been killed since the fighting erupted in April, according to United Nations figures. Tensions escalated after the two separatist city-states, Donetsk and Luhansk, held leadership elections on Sunday. The government in Kiev, which called the elections illegal, moved to cut off the regions physically and financially. It revoked a law that would have given the two regions some autonomy. Taken together, the various steps made prospects for a peaceful settlement look weaker than they have since before a tentative peace plan, including a cease-fire, was signed on Sept. 5. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called a meeting of his security chiefs to discuss the deteriorating situation late Thursday, but no new measures were announced afterward. Mr. Putin has said nothing about the separatist elections. Russia denies arming the rebels, and the government, while supporting the elections, stopped short of recognizing them, a step that might well prompt further economic sanctions by Europe. Russia is wrestling with a steep drop in oil prices that continues, along with the tension in Ukraine, to push the ruble to record lows against the dollar. In Moscow, a senior presidential aide, Yuri Ushakov, drew a careful line around the Kremlin\u2019s position on Friday, saying that while it \u201crespected\u201d the outcome of the vote, that did not amount to recognition. \u201cThese are different words,\u201d Mr. Ushakov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. \u201cThe word \u2018respect\u2019 was chosen deliberately.\u201d Mr. Ushakov said the government still supported the cease-fire agreement and expected negotiations on its further implementation to continue. \u201cBut not everything depends on us,\u201d he was quoted as saying. \u201cThere are a lot of factors.\u201d The often ambiguous Russian position has left many analysts to conclude that Moscow seeks to create a \u201cfrozen conflict\u201d in eastern Ukraine that would continue to destabilize the entire country, ensuring Moscow\u2019s continued influence and complicating Kiev\u2019s goal of drawing closer to Europe. Mr. Putin is expected to meet a variety of European and Asian leaders, and possibly President Obama, on the sidelines of conferences in China and Australia next week. (On Friday, The Advocate, the gay and lesbian newsmagazine based in Los Angeles, named Mr. Putin, who has broadly denounced gay rights, person of the year., saying he was the \u201csingle greatest threat\u201d to gays worldwide in 2014.) Among other issues, leaders are expected to discuss the investigation into the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine in July. Russia has accused Ukraine of shooting down the plane, while Western leaders have said it was most certainly shot down by Ukrainian separatists wielding a Russian surface-to-air missile. A new attempt to move all the wreckage to the Netherlands, where the flight originated and which is leading the investigation, was suspended on Friday after more human remains were found, according to Donetsk separatists quoted by Russia\u2019s Tass news agency.", "articleHeader": "Ukraine Accuses Russia of Sending Tanks Across Border"}, {"articleBiased": true, "articleUrl": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/opinion/roger-cohen-the-iran-ukraine-affair.html?_r=0", "articleSrc": "NYT", "articleText": " Have you heard about the Iran-Ukraine affair? It goes like this. Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia makes nice over an Iran nuclear deal. It is helpful in every way. A recent headline on a piece by my colleague David Sanger read, \u201cRole for Russia Gives Iran Talks a Possible Boost.\u201d In return, the United States turns a blind eye to the big Russian military build-up on the Ukrainian border and in areas under the control of Moscow-backed rebel separatists. I am not suggesting there is any such formal Iran-Ukraine trade-off between the Obama administration and Putin. I am suggesting that the Russian leader has a keen eye for American weakness and an exquisite sense of timing. The abrupt flaring of new fighting in eastern Ukraine, and the abrupt Russian readiness to help on Iran ahead of the Nov. 24 deadline for nuclear talks, are not a mere coincidence. They are part of a Russian strategy and, for now, the United States is playing along. An Iran nuclear deal would be good for the United States, Iran and the world. President Obama understands its importance, hence his recent reported letter to the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. An accord could place all Iran\u2019s irreversible nuclear capacity in a limited and verifiable box, ensuring there is never an Iranian bomb, while ushering the last sizeable emerging market nation into the global economy. It would change the blocked politics of the Middle East, confounding America\u2019s enemies and forcing sometimes manipulative allies to think in new and perhaps constructive ways. The deal, at this point, represents the last hope for any significant Obama legacy in the Middle East. It is clear that he wants it. But the unspoken price of an Iran deal, vital as it is, cannot be the loss of Ukraine and the unraveling of NATO. Putin has already annexed Crimea despite Russia\u2019s signed agreement in 1994 \u201cto respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.\u201d There is every reason to believe he has designs on all Ukraine. The West\u2019s mistake has been to think that Putin is not serious in wishing to reconstitute the Soviet Union in new guise. The current Russian buildup has all the signs of preparation for an offensive. Large, unmarked convoys of heavy weapons and tanks manned by personnel without insignia on their uniforms (like those who took over Crimea) have been seen rumbling toward the front lines in rebel-held territory. Sophisticated artillery and ground-to-air missile systems have been moved into position. Units all the way from the east and far north of Russia have been massed. You don\u2019t move military units thousands of miles for nothing. A retired NATO general who recently held talks with the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, told me that intelligence estimates are of some 45,000 regular Russian troops on the border; tens of thousands of Russian irregulars of various stripes inside Ukraine organized by a smaller number of Russian officers and military personnel; some 450 battle tanks and over 700 pieces of artillery. \u201cUkraine has no real fighting capacity to face all this,\u201d he said. \u201cThey think we\u2019re their friends and don\u2019t understand why we won\u2019t help them. They are frustrated and afraid because they can see a hammer coming at them.\u201d In response to Putin\u2019s hammer, the West has expressed concern. The United States National Security Council spokeswoman has said, \u201cWe are very concerned.\u201d The European Union has called the reports of convoys of heavy weapons \u201cvery worrying.\u201d Concern and worry do not stop a hammer. Poroshenko\u2019s requests to Obama for substantial American military assistance should not have been rejected. Watch Putin\u2019s actions. Be very wary of his words. That is the lesson of the past year. It has not been learned. It is nice that the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and Secretary of State John Kerry have just agreed to exchange information on Ukraine and called for respect for a September cease-fire that is unraveling in the smoke and fire of Donetsk. It is also meaningless. Lavrov feigns the innocent on the military buildup. That\u2019s his good-cop role. The reality is dangerous. A quarter-century after the fall of the Berlin Wall, as balloons go up in the German capital, a nation of 45 million people that wants to enjoy the fruits of European freedom is being abandoned to Russian dismemberment. If that happens, if Ukraine is lost, America\u2019s promise to its NATO allies in the Baltics and Eastern Europe is not going to be viewed as credible. A core Russian strategic objective since 1945 \u2014 the decoupling of American and European defense \u2014 will be on its way to realization. I just hope the refrain inside the White House is not: \u201cWe can\u2019t annoy the Russians on Ukraine. They\u2019re being helpful on Iran. We won\u2019t get a deal without them.\u201d But I wouldn\u2019t bet on it. An Iran-Ukraine affair is plausible.", "articleHeader": "The Iran-Ukraine Affair"}]
