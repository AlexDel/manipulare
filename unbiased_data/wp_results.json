(Darko Vojinovic/AP)  BRUSSELS \u2013 Amid the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, a tide of thousands of asylum-seekers is reaching the continent\u2019s shores faster than they can be accommodated. So far, the European Union\u2019s 28 nations have been unable to agree on a solution. Ahead of a European Commission proposal\u00a0 Wednesday for a system to spread asylum-seekers across all E.U. countries, here are a few of the options Europe is considering: 1) Doing nothing. Europe\u00a0 tried to make a plan to share out refugees earlier in the summer. At the time, they were talking about only 40,000 people. But that failed after many countries, especially in eastern and central Europe, bridled at being required to take in a set number of refugees. Now the proposal is expected to be triple that \u2013 amid deep doubts about nations\u2019 ability to come to an agreement. Pros: Few, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen. Each European leader answers to his or her own electorate, which sometimes makes broad E.U. deals very difficult. The status quo is good for countries that don\u2019t like refugees and under current E.U. rules can deport asylum-seekers back to the first E.U. country they entered. That\u2019s almost always Greece, Italy or Hungary, which are buckling under the influx. Cons: \u201cIf Europe fails on the question of refugees, then it won\u2019t be the Europe we wished for,\u201d said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has thrown open her nation\u2019s doors to asylum-seekers. She warned that without a Europe-wide plan, individual nations might need to reimpose border controls, a major blow to European unity. And with some nations far more generous to refugees than others, human smugglers will prosper, ferrying asylum-seekers to Germany and Sweden, with potentially tragic consequences. 2) Quotas. This is what European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will propose\u00a0 Wednesday. He\u2019ll suggest relocating 120,000 asylum-seekers from the front-line nations of Greece, Italy and Hungary and spreading them across Europe, according to European accounts of the draft plans. Together, Germany, France and Spain would take more than half of them, according to a rough draft published by Spain\u2019s El Pais newspaper. The remainder would be spread across the rest of Europe. Pros: It would help reduce the burden on those three European nations that are on the edges of the European Union and have buckled under the weight of the more than 400,000 asylum-seekers who have arrived so far this year. And though the proposal would fall far short of the numbers needed to address the full scale of the problem, it would still set up a system that could later be expanded. Nations that have resisted hosting refugees, such as Slovakia, may be able to send money instead as a compromise measure. \u201cConsidering the current politics, it is the most pragmatic idea on the table right now,\u201d said Elizabeth Collett, the director of the Brussels-based Migration Policy Institute Europe. Cons: It\u2019s a drop in the bucket. Germany plans to take in 800,000 asylum-seekers this year, and says it\u2019s ready for 500,000 a year for the next several years. Facing\u00a0those numbers, the E.U. plan simply doesn\u2019t do enough. And there are many thorny questions to work out: What happens when an asylum-seeker who has family in France gets assigned to Lithuania instead? In a Europe without borders, how would policymakers ensure the refugees stay put? And what happens to asylum-seekers who arrive beyond the quotas? Do they pile up in refugee camps on Europe\u2019s edges, or do they simply keep pushing through to Western Europe? And many nations, especially in Eastern and Central Europe, are opposed to quotas. \u201cI do not consider them any real solution to the migration crisis,\" Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said Monday, according to the Czech News Agency. \u00a0 3) Military action against the smugglers who bring help refugees get to Europe. Britain and others have been pushing for U.N. Security Council authorization to deploy navies to board and intercept the flimsy boats that set sail across the Mediterranean from Libya and Egypt to Europe\u2019s shores. The boats, operated by human smugglers, are dangerous, frequently sinking during the passage. More than 2,700 migrants have died this year. Pros: The plan would discourage the smugglers, who often have ties to organized crime and profit tremendously from the some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations. Fewer boats crossing the Mediterranean would reduce the immediate crisis for Europe and might discourage some of the economic migrants coming illegally from Africa and South Asia. And a stepped-up naval presence in the Mediterranean might make search-and-rescue operations more successful when smugglers\u2019 ships capsize. Cons: Stopping smugglers doesn\u2019t address the root causes of the refugee crisis. It just displaces the burden to other countries. And in some ways, these plans are a solution to yesterday\u2019s problem. Over the course of this year, the bulk of migrant traffic to Europe has shifted westward to the Balkans: asylum-seekers make a short sea hop from Turkey to nearby Greek islands, then travel to Western Europe overland through Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary. The naval plans wouldn\u2019t do anything about that at all. 4) Resettling refugees directly from camps surrounding Syria, and from Syria. Remember \"Schindler\u2019s List?\" Or the U.S. efforts to resettle refugees from Vietnam in the 1970s? This would be the 21st-century equivalent, more or less: E.U. diplomats handing out visas on the ground in the countries where more than 4 million Syrian refugees have settled. Pros: This is arguably the most humane option, since it would \u00a0make an end-run around smugglers. Refugees could simply get on a plane from Turkey, Lebanon or Jordan and fly straight to Europe, saving the danger of a smuggled, overland trip that sometimes costs up to $10,000. It\u2019s what British Prime Minister David Cameron suggested\u00a0 Monday when he said Britain would take in 20,000 Syrian refugees directly from the Middle Eastern camps over the next five years. \u201cWe want to encourage people not to make that dangerous crossing in the first place,\u201d Cameron said. Cons: Realistically, there\u2019s little political support in Europe to do this on a scale that would actually relieve pressure on the camps. Cameron\u2019s commitment over the next five years is equivalent to what Germany took in this weekend alone. And it\u2019s not clear that handing out visas in the region would stop the separate overland flow to Europe. That\u2019s because the most vulnerable refugees typically jump to the front of the line for resettlement schemes such as the British one. The asylum-seekers currently coming to Europe by land are the ones with the resources to pay a sometimes hefty price to smugglers. \u201cWhen you are facing a humanitarian disaster, when you are facing the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when you say, \u2018I think we can resettle 25 people,' people would just laugh in your face,\u201d said Elspeth Guild, a migration specialist at the Brussels-based Center for European Policy Studies \u00a05) Bring peace to Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Eritrea. Those are the conflict-ridden countries that are supplying the bulk of the asylum-seekers to Europe. If there wasn\u2019t violence there, Europe wouldn\u2019t have a refugee problem. Pros: Everyone\u2019s happy. Cons: Not going to happen anytime soon.", "articleSrc": "WP", "articleBiased": false}, {"articleUrl": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/after-tragedies-eu-leaders-will-meet-on-refugees/2015/08/31/567a93fc-4f6d-11e5-b225-90edbd49f362_story.html", "articleHeader": "E.U. leaders show little unity ahead of emergency conclave on refugees", "articleText": "  BRUSSELS \u2014 European leaders traded barbs Monday about who was to blame for a worsening migration crisis, as mounting calls to take in desperate asylum-seekers mixed with skepticism that swift changes would actually take place. There was little unity ahead of an emergency meeting planned to be held in two weeks, despite a growing agreement that Europe\u2019s unpredictable asylum system has spurred migrants to take dangerous steps to scale the continent\u2019s high walls. The problem has grown worse by the day, with aid groups in Greece saying that new arrivals were on track Monday to top record-breaking weekend highs. From Greece, migrants flow northward through the Balkans in an attempt to reach Western Europe, where generous benefits can await. But if they are caught by poorer E.U. countries along the way, their future can be grim, a disparity that has spurred many to pay smugglers to sneak them into the heart of Europe. That gamble can have tragic consequences. Last week, the bodies of 71 presumed migrants were found in the back of a delivery truck on an Austrian roadside. They are thought to have suffocated,   [As tragedies shock Europe, a bigger refu\u00adgee crisis looms in the Middle East]  At a time when Germany is taking the lion\u2019s share of refugees \u2014 an estimated 800,000 this year alone \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday urged other nations in the European Union to share the burden. She called for new E.U.-run asylum processing centers in entry nations such as Greece to better assess and safely funnel refugees deeper into Europe.        1 of 24       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                       Skip Ad   \u00d7           Suspects arrested in deaths of migrants      View Photos   A Hungarian court placed four men under preliminary arrest for being involved in the deaths of 71 migrants found in a truck in Austria.

Top E.U. officials plan to meet Sept. 14 to try to streamline the fragmented asylum process.  The leaders of Germany and France want to achieve that goal by speeding deportations of economic migrants while allocating more resources to people fleeing the wars in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. They have also proposed a quota system under which each of the 28 E.U. nations commits to resettle a certain number of refugees, taking aim at countries such as Hungary, which is building a fence to keep migrants out. \u201cOur responsibility is to make sure that asylum rights are respected,\u201d French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Monday during a visit to the French port city of Calais, where migrants seeking to reach Britain have gathered. \u201cTo do so, we cannot build barbed-wire fences against those who are tortured in their own countries.\u201d But there were signs that unity within Europe\u2019s consensus-driven policymaking would be elusive. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico on Monday firmly rejected any decision that would force his nation to take in a fixed number of refugees. \u201cWe strongly reject any quotas,\u201d Fico told reporters in the Slovakian capital, Bratislava, according to the news agency Reuters. \u201cWe will wake up one day and have 100,000 people from the Arab world, and that is a problem I would not like Slovakia to have.\u201d Britain, too, seems unlikely to throw open its doors. Over the weekend, British Home Secretary Theresa May said she wanted to cut back even legal migration from other E.U. nations.   [Black route: One family\u2019s journey from Aleppo to Austria]  The patchwork of responses in Europe appears to be fueling a booming trade for smugglers, who help migrants get from less-generous nations such as Hungary into Germany, which awards far more benefits to refugees. Migrants are under pressure because of the wide disparities in the way European countries have responded to the crisis. A quirk of European law allows nations to deport asylum-seekers to the first E.U. country where their presence was registered by authorities. Hungary\u2019s far-right leaders have had the toughest response in Europe, stringing a line of razor wire along their country\u2019s 109-mile border with Serbia and building a taller fence behind it. Crowds of asylum-seekers packed Budapest\u2019s fin-de-siecle train station on Monday. There were signs that Hungarian authorities were relaxing their hard-line stance, allowing hundreds of migrants onto trains headed to Austria, from where many planned to continue on to Germany.  The unpredictable policies have fueled many migrants\u2019 willingness to pay as much as several thousand euros to smugglers who move them to their destinations out of sight from authorities. E.U. leaders have grown increasingly concerned about the problem.  \u201cThe only people who benefit from unilateralism are the smugglers,\u201d said Alexander Betts, director of the Refugee Studies Center at the University of Oxford. \u201cAbout the only area where there\u2019s consensus in Europe is that the current system is dysfunctional.\u201d Separately, Greece\u2019s coast guard said Monday that it had picked up more than 2,400 migrants in dozens of sea-based search-and-rescue missions over the weekend, a sign that the flow of asylum-seekers is continuing unabated.    [A glimpse of what it\u2019s like for refugees transported in a small van]   Aid workers on the Greek island of Lesvos, a first port of call for many migrants coming from Turkey, which neighbors Syria, said it was swiftly becoming overwhelmed with new asylum-seekers, who are arriving faster than others can be transported away. \u201cThe system broke this weekend, particularly yesterday,\u201d said Simon Clarke, deputy team leader of the International Rescue Committee team on Lesvos. In a telephone interview, he said Monday\u2019s numbers appeared likely to rival the about 4,000 who arrived a day earlier \u2014 nearly four times as many as had been coming just 10 days ago. Refugee advocates also want to establish a process by which asylum-seekers could file applications with Europe even before they cross the continent\u2019s borders. Armed with the proper paperwork, they could bypass the dangerous sea journey altogether. But even the most generous E.U. nations may be wary of creating too streamlined a process for refugee claims, fearful that they would make it too easy for the millions of Syrians who have fled to Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan to move to Europe, analysts say. \u201cIt\u2019s not the fear of who comes this year, but of how many could come next year, and the unknown, that sometimes holds politicians back from establishing a process that would help countries like Turkey and Lebanon,\u201d said Elizabeth Collett, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe.

Most endured a perilous crossing to Greece aboard rafts and boats, some barely fit to sail. They traversed Greece, a nation paralyzed by economic crisis and too poor to handle a flow of people that in July hit a record high. At the border with Macedonia late last week, they trudged through a wall of riot police, who fought them back with tear gas before relenting. Now, the asylum-seekers, thousands a day, are racing into Hungary, which is rushing to complete a barbed-wire border fence by the end of the month to force them to seek other routes. It is a long parade of misery unparalleled in Europe in recent years. But the continent has so far failed to agree how to respond. Amid a refugee crisis that by some measures is the worst since World War II, individual nations are being left to improvise their own measures. In Hungary, that is taking the form of 108 miles of barbed wire and fencing. The crisis is shaking fundamental tenets of European life, including the principle of free movement between most of the nations of the European Union. It is fueling a surge of anti-migrant sentiment in the countries that are housing the bulk of the asylum-seekers, Germany and Sweden. And it is straining the weakest countries, such as Greece, that are on migration\u2019s front lines. \u201cUnless we do something, we will become a lifeboat sinking under the weight of people holding on to it and drowning everybody, both those seeking help and those offering help,\u201d said Janos Lazar, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban\u2019s chief of staff, at a ceremony last week celebrating the founding of Hungary.   The surging numbers of asylum-seekers are being propelled by violence in the Middle East, instability in Africa and poverty in South Asia. Many who fled the war in Syria and stayed for years in neighboring nations are giving up on returning home. Fresh waves are leaving because of the violence of the Islamic State. Germany alone expects 800,000 asylum-seekers this year, a fourfold increase over 2014. The overall E.U. numbers have tripled compared with last year. According to E.U. law, asylum-seekers are supposed to apply for help in their first port of entry. In reality, many front-line countries give them transit papers or look the other way as they slip onward to richer nations within Europe\u2019s borderless Schengen zone. Their arrivals are reverberating around Europe. Earlier in August, thousands of refugees piled up in Calais, France, seeking to cross to Britain through the railway tunnel that exits there. On Saturday, the Italian coast guard rescued about 4,400 migrants from overcrowded ships off the coast of Libya. Even the theoretical idea of refugees is controversial: Slovakia, which has taken in just a handful, said last week that it wanted only Christian asylum-seekers before reversing itself. Tiny Baltic nations have revolted at a proposal to make them each shelter a couple of hundred. \u201cAll of those dynamics point to a Europe that is not finding ways to cooperate,\u201d said Alexander Betts, director of the Refugee Studies Center at the University of Oxford. \u201cAnd while Europe squabbles, people die.\u201d An obstacle, not barrier In Hungary, workers have raced to complete the fence by the end of August. In some stretches of the 108-mile-long frontier with Serbia, it is composed of tall coils of razor wire. In others, it is a 10-foot-tall fence. The construction of the barrier is rich with irony, since one of the first holes in the Iron Curtain was created by Hungary\u2019s 1989 decision to cut open its border fence with Austria to allow East German asylum-seekers to flee there. In 2004, when Hungary joined the European Union, it joyfully cut through the remainder of its border fence with Austria. On Monday, a record 2,093 asylum-seekers crossed into Hungary, about double the flow of most days in recent weeks, according to police figures. Tuesday\u2019s number looked likely to rival Monday\u2019s, said Babar Baloch, a Budapest-based spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).   After migrants inside a camp on the border with Serbia chanted \"U.N.\" and \"help us,\" Hungarian police shot clouds of teargas into the crowds, dispersing the group. Hungary made plans on Aug. 26 to reinforce its southern border with helicopters, mounted police and dogs. (Reuters)   \u201cWhat these fences do is push these people into the hands of more-ruthless smugglers and put them in even more danger,\u201d Baloch said. But it does not stop them. \u201cThey have already taken so many risks. So they will take more risks.\u201d  Local leaders say that the fence is not enough. \u201cIt isn't worth anything,\u201d said Istvan Fackelmann, the deputy mayor of Asotthalom, a small Hungarian border town. \u201cThey pass by or climb over.\u201d Hungary is just a waypoint for most of the migrants. But each step of their journey has been getting more difficult. Greece, the first E.U. entry point for most of them, nearly was kicked out of the euro zone in July, further challenging its ability to handle the record flows of asylum-seekers. Macedonia is their next step, but on Thursday it suddenly decided to close a major border crossing, sending out riot-gear-clad soldiers who formed a wall with their shields that held back a jostling crowd of thousands. The riot squad used tear gas to push people back toward Greece. \u201cPeople were coming from behind, they were pushing and shoving, and they were passing children to the front because they thought the children could go through,\u201d said Alexandra Krause, a senior protection officer with the UNHCR who watched the scene at the Gevgelija crossing on Thursday and Friday. When the Macedonian government relented and reopened the border late Friday, she said, a backlog of about 7,500 asylum-seekers continued the journey northward through the Balkans by rail and bus. On Tuesday the migrant flows were much calmer, she said by telephone from the border crossing. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said this week she would demand that other European nations take in asylum-seekers. The dilemma is dominating her schedule. On Wednesday, she plans to visit Heidenau, a town in Germany\u2019s ex-communist east where hundreds of anti-immigrant protesters rioted Saturday as refugees arrived by bus. On Thursday, she will attend a summit on the Western Balkans that will focus on the flows of migrants. \u201cGermany is a country that respects the dignity of every human being,\u201d Merkel said Monday, speaking alongside French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande after meeting with him about the crisis. Other European countries are \u201cnot currently implementing\u201d their laws on asylum, she said.  Gergo Saling in Budapest contributed to this report.

The newcomers from Syria and other war-ravaged nations would enjoy freshly redone floors, cute balconies and shiny, modern appliances in a cheerful building near a timber-framed pub.  Then Meissen\u2019s goodwill went up in smoke. On a cool night six weeks ago, suspected right-wing arsonists struck the building, scorching its interior and rendering it uninhabitable days before the \u00adasylum-seekers were to move in. The attack added Meissen, a gothic castle town of 30,000 on the Elbe River, to a string of German cities caught up in an escalating rash of violence against refugees.  [\u2018Let the hag burn\u2019: Xenophobic attacks in Germany ignite firestorm]  The acts include an ugly spate of arson targeting refugee centers as well as physical attacks on refugees themselves, marking the return of what critics say is an unnerving brand of xenophobia to Western Europe\u2019s most populous nation.   German news anchor Claus Kleber of ZDF television welled up as he told the story of a Bavarian bus driver who welcomed 15 refugees on his bus with this announcement: \"I have an important message for people from the whole world in this bus: Welcome!\" (The Washington Post)   The attacks are undercutting Germany\u2019s image as the country leading the effort to aid a record flow of refugees into Europe, highlighting the rising social tensions in the region amid the avalanche of asylum-seekers. At the same time, the violence has ignited a heated national debate over what pundits here say is a rise in overt racism and intolerance \u2014 in a nation highly sensitive to both because of Nazi-era atrocities. All this is happening as Germany takes in more asylum-seekers than any other nation in Europe \u2014 a number set to reach an estimated 500,000 this year alone \u2014 while quickly running out of places to house them. As a result, the national government in Berlin is turning to insular and almost wholly white enclaves to take in the newcomers, who are mostly from the Middle East and Africa. In communities such as Meissen, in Germany\u2019s formerly communist east, that has been a recipe for friction. \u201cIn east Germany, we have had 25\u00a0years of very powerful influence by neo-Nazi culture. Few immigrants were going there out of fear of being threatened,\u201d said Anetta Kahane, chairwoman of the pro-refugee Amadeu Antonio Foundation in Berlin. \u201cNow you see these asylum-seekers placed in cities in the east, a part of the country that is completely white. Sometimes the response is pure racism.\u201d A surge in aggression The arson in Meissen, for instance, immediately exposed a fierce strain of opposition to the new refugee center. A new local anti-refugee group \u2014 the Homeland Defense Initiative \u2014 drew as many as 650 supporters to a rally last week, far more than pro-refugee groups have managed to muster. Many neighbors who live near the burned refugee center are blaming not the arsonists but the building\u2019s owner \u2014 local developer Ingolf Brumm \u2014 for having agreed to turn it into a shelter. After Brumm publicly denounced the fire, he and his family received death threats and were viciously harassed online. To protect him, police began patrolling his nearby home office. Recently arrived refugees already living in Meissen have also become targets. One Syrian dentist who was assigned to live in Meissen and arrived Aug.\u00a01 said he has had stones thrown at his apartment door, glue put in his lock and obscenities hurled at him from the street. \u201cAfter the fire, the neighbors yelled out at me, saying \u2018Good,\u2019 and \u2018It\u2019s about time someone did something to stop this,\u2019\u2009\u201d Brumm said as he surveyed the damage to his building last week. \u201cI thought I knew the citizens of Meissen, but I was wrong. There are good people here but also people with hate in their hearts.\u201d   One neighbor shedding no tears over the torching is Wolfgang Hempel, 65, a retired electrician who lives adjacent to the attacked building. Referring to Brumm, Hempel said he \u201chates his guts\u201d for leasing the building to the city for a refugee center. \u201cGermany is turning black,\u201d Hempel said, citing the massive influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East. \u201cSoon only dark-skinned people will be living here. It can\u2019t go on like this.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009. And these days, everybody puts you in a Nazi corner just for voicing your opinion.\u201d Aggression against the mounting number of refugees coming into Europe has surfaced in France, Greece and other nations in the region. And the German public overall remains relatively more tolerant than the populations of many other European nations. Unlike France and Holland, for instance, anti-immigrant nationalists in Germany are still struggling at the polls. The incidents in Germany include at least six cases of arson and the beating of a 23-year-old African refu\u00adgee by five Germans that left him with serious injuries. But the attacks are not as severe as the wave of anti-foreigner violence that swept Germany in the early and mid-1990s. In one infamous 1993 attack, for instance, neo-Nazis set ablaze the home of Turkish immigrants in the rust belt region of North Rhine-Westphalia, killing five people and injuring 14 others. Nonetheless, the number of acts of aggression against refugee homes in Germany is rapidly rising \u2014 reaching 202 so far this year, compared with 198 during all of 2014. Last month, a group of right-wing protesters attacked Red Cross workers in the eastern German city of Dresden as they sought to set up a tent compound for refugees. \u2018Let the hag burn\u2019 The attacks have put Germany on edge, igniting a social media firestorm while raising lofty questions about what modern Germany stands for. In one high-profile commentary this month, German anchorwoman Anja \u00adReschke issued a blistering on-air critique of the attacks and the verbal vitriol circulating against refugees on German social media. Rather than anonymous comments, many are now being openly signed, indicating, she said, that hate has become more socially acceptable. She suggested that those Germans who remain quiet are also guilty. \u201cIf you\u2019re not of the opinion that all refugees are spongers who should be hunted down, burned or gassed, then you should make that known very clearly,\u201d she said in her commentary. The spot \u2014 viewed more than 15\u00a0million times online \u2014 provoked an outpouring of support, she said. But it also produced a flood of even more foul comments aimed at her.  [Meet Angela Merkel, a migrant baby born in Germany]  \u201cI received e-mails saying \u2018Let the hag burn\u2019 and calling me a \u2018negro-gypsy-whore,\u2019\u2009\u201d Reschke, a white ethnic German, said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd then there were the people who said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m afraid our race is getting polluted by all those evil people from the whole of Africa, but no, I\u2019m not a Nazi.\u2019\u2009\u201d Although the attacks have been scattered nationwide, some of the worst have been in the former communist east where diversity levels are extremely low. While one major anti-refugee movement that launched last year \u2014 known as PEGIDA \u2014 has begun to fade, it has been replaced by several splinter groups and wholly different anti-refugee and far-right groups that have sparked alarm among German politicians. In Meissen, pro-refugee activists, including the Rev. Bernd Oehler, 55, have led an effort to counter the naysayers and welcome the newcomers, staging food and clothing drives and organizing rallies and choir celebrations to show their support. But Oehler conceded that a vocal minority of strong opposition remains across the former East Germany, where economic development still lags behind the wealthier west. \u201cWe have a problem with the middle of society,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are afraid. They don\u2019t know about their futures, and now there\u2019s a new issue for them to worry about with the refugees.

The late-night offer came after days of efforts to repel migrants fleeing war and poverty who have streamed into Hungary in a bid to reach Western Europe, where they hope to begin new lives. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban had painted his hard-line approach against the mostly Muslim asylum-seekers as a stand to preserve Europe as a Christian continent. But after a column of migrants more than a mile long streamed onto Hungary\u2019s main highway to Austria, it appeared that authorities felt they had no alternative but to pass the challenge to their neighbor, another country that has been ambivalent about the influx. By early Saturday morning, the first asylum seekers began to walk across the border into Austria after having been dropped off by buses on the Hungarian side. The buses had picked people up at Budapest's main train station. After initial hesitation, the crowds began to climb on board, relieved to be en route out of\u00a0Hungary.\u00a0 At Keleti train station in Budapest, where thousands of migrants had camped out for nearly a week, the central plaza was nearly empty on Saturday morning except for a maintenance crew hosing down the site.   The Hungarian decision to provide up to 100 buses to take the asylum-seekers to the border did little to resolve the challenge facing Europe, which has failed to come up with a unified response to the mounting numbers on its borders. Instead, the plans simply shifted the crisis to another state, leaving the fundamental problem \u2014 a bloc of 503\u00a0million people unable to agree whether and how to house several hundred thousand refugees \u2014 to burn for another day. \u201cThe European Union has proved to be inadequate to address the situation,\u201d Janos Lazar, the Hungarian prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, said in an address in parliament. He said that the decision had been made to clear the roads to ensure the country\u2019s transportation security.   Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said that he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had agreed to take in the asylum-seekers that Hungary was moving to the border. \u201cOn the basis of today\u2019s emergency at the Hungarian border, Austria and Germany are allowing an onward journey of the refugees into their countries in this instance,\u201d Faymann said in a statement on his Facebook page. But he suggested that it was a one-time agreement, leaving the broader issue unresolved In recent days, Hungarian authorities had tried to halt the asylum-seekers\u2019 journey by stopping rail traffic, penning them in migrant camps and bolstering security at the border. A tense day-long standoff on a halted train about 20 miles west of Budapest ended after many of the train\u2019s occupants stormed police lines and walked to the highway to join a larger group that had already started out from Budapest. Others \u2014 mostly women and children \u2014 agreed to go to a nearby migration processing camp. More than 1,000 asylum-seekers walked on the shoulder of the highway as trucks whizzed by Friday night. Fathers carried sleeping toddlers on their shoulders. Old men hobbled on canes. Near the front of the crowd, one man waved a blue and gold European Union flag.        1 of 40       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                              Sept. 4, 2015                                                            Skip Ad   \u00d7           Refugees leave Hungarian train station on foot toward Austria      View Photos   Hundreds of refugees frustrated at being stuck at two train stations in Hungary set off for Austria, one group forming a line nearly a half-mile long as they streamed out of Budapest, the other breaking out of a train near a migrant reception center.

Her 10-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son walked alongside. Kaman said she hoped to go to Sweden, where authorities have promised permanent residency to Syrian refugees.

Hungarian lawmakers, fearful of the influx of asylum-seekers from conflict-torn Middle Eastern nations, approved measures Friday that gave authorities sweeping powers to seal the border and detain migrants who crossed the 108-mile razor-wire fence that was recently erected across the frontier with Serbia. \u201cThe reality is that Europe is threatened by a mass inflow of people. Many tens of millions of people could come to Europe,\u201d Orban said Friday on Hungarian national radio. \u201cNow we talk about hundreds of thousands, but next year we will talk about millions, and there is no end to this,\u201d the prime minister said. \u201cAll of a sudden we will see that we are in a minority in our own continent.\u201d Hungarian leaders had said they were simply following E.U. regulations in their harsh response, so tough that they declined U.N. offers of emergency aid for the migrants. But the rules have proved radically inadequate for the situation because they place most of the burden of dealing with asylum-seekers on the first E.U. country they enter. That has forced poorer countries such as Greece, Hungary and Italy to the forefront as many richer ones have taken a back seat. The vast majority of asylum-seekers arriving in Hungary simply want to move on to Germany and Sweden, but leaders there have said they cannot shoulder the full burden of the arrivals. Instead, migrants have gathered in the subterranean passages near Budapest\u2019s main train station as they plot their next move. Hungary\u2019s nationalist government enjoys broad public support. But not all citizens are opposed to the asylum-seekers. \u201cMy stomach is shaking when I see these little kids,\u201d said Attila Gadl, who drove his minivan to the roadside to hand out loaves of bread, water and reflective vests to the crowds straggling by. Many countries have refused to commit to mandatory targets for taking in refugees. Central European leaders convening in Prague said they would not support a joint German and French proposal to institute quotas that would require each European Union nation to take a designated number of refugees. Many nations have been less willing to accept asylum-seekers than Germany, which has said it expects 800,000 this year. Slovakia, for example, has said it will take only Christians. On Friday, British Prime Minister David Cameron reversed a pledge not to take more refugees, citing \u201cthe scale of the crisis and the suffering of people.\u201d He said that his nation would accept \u201cthousands\u201d from the packed camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, where millions of people have been displaced by Syria\u2019s civil war, and that he would offer more details next week.  [Hungary\u2019s maverick prime minister becomes Europe\u2019s Donald Trump]   The package of measures approved Friday by Hungary\u2019s parliament made crossing or damaging the border fence a criminal offense, punishable by up to three years in prison. Hungarian authorities will also be able to set up migrant camps at the frontier, where asylum-seekers can be confined as their requests are processed. Orban aims to seal the border by Sept.\u00a015. The pressure is rapidly building as record numbers of asylum-seekers reach Europe\u2019s shores faster than authorities can decide what to do with them. Riots broke out Friday on the Greek island of Lesvos, where more than 1,000 migrants tried to board a packed ferry for mainland Greece. Police used stun grenades to push them back. Authorities think that more than 15,000 asylum-seekers are on the tourist island, but there are facilities for far fewer. The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that nearly 5,600 people crossed from Greece to Macedonia a day earlier, double the figures that had been seen in recent days. Those numbers were already unprecedented. \u201cThe only ones who benefit from the lack of a common European response are the smugglers and traffickers who are making profit from people\u2019s desperation to reach safety,\u201d U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said Friday in a statement. He said Europe needed to make as many as 200,000 spots for new refugees. Plans circulating in Brussels appear far less generous.

At U.N. headquarters in New York on Monday, E.U. foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told the Security Council that the unprecedented flow of migrants seeking to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean has necessitated \u201can exceptional response.\u201d \u201cWe cannot do it alone. This has to be a common global effort. That\u2019s why we count on your support to save lives and dismantle criminal organizations that are exploiting people\u2019s desperation,\u201d Mogherini told the 15-nation council. The E.U. proposal would allow the bloc to deploy military force to seize and destroy smugglers\u2019 ships before they take on their human cargo.  [3 reasons why Europe is being held responsible for migrant deaths in the Mediterranean]  E.U. leaders see the program as an essential step to curb the dangerous crossings, which have left 1,800 people dead this year as the packed and poorly maintained ships have sunk, run aground or overturned on the high seas. The death toll is 20 times as high as it was at this time last year. But it is unclear whether the E.U. can win Security Council support. Russia has said it opposes any attempt to destroy smugglers\u2019 ships, arguing that the owners in many cases do not know the purpose for which the vessels are being used. Authorities in Libya, the anarchic and divided nation that is the primary source of migrant smuggling, have been either cool to the idea or openly hostile. Rights groups, meanwhile, say that a focus on military action will not solve the crisis, and may make it worse. Amnesty International released a report Monday that described horrendous living conditions for migrants in Libya and concluded that military efforts would \u201ceffectively contribute to migrants and refugees being trapped in Libya and expose them to a risk of serious human rights abuses.\u201d The group urged Tunisia and Egypt to open their borders to migrants seeking an escape from Libya, allowing them a safer route out than the one by sea.  [Map: Hundreds presumed lost at sea]  The E.U. has been roundly criticized for not doing enough to stem the crisis, which is being fed by an exodus of people from Africa and the Middle East fleeing war, poverty and oppression. An Italian-run search-and-rescue mission estimated to have saved more than 100,000 lives was canceled last year. After more than 800 people died in a single shipwreck last month, E.U. officials voted to triple funding for a new maritime patrol mission, though it remains more limited in scope than its predecessor. Meanwhile, an E.U. proposal to more evenly distribute asylum-seekers across Europe appeared to be in trouble Monday, even before it is due to be officially unveiled. The European Commission is expected to release the plan on Wednesday. It calls for establishing E.U.-wide quotas that would dictate the minimum number of asylum-seekers accepted by each of the union\u2019s 28 members. The idea is to ease the burden on front-line states along Europe\u2019s southern periphery, which are suffering under the strain of the tens of thousands of migrants seeking entry. The proposal is strongly backed by those countries and by Germany, which registers more asylum applications than any other nation in Europe. But it has been vigorously opposed by several East European nations, as well as by Britain, where the Conservative government is under intense pressure to limit immigration. A British government spokesman, speaking Monday under customary rules of anonymity, cited previous statements by Prime Minister David Cameron that Britain \u201cwould be playing its role in tackling the current crisis in the Mediterranean but that our focus would be on saving lives, not offering people asylum in the U.K.\u201d  Read more:   U.N. estimates up to 850 migrants perished in capsized boat off Libya   Why the Mediterranean migrant disaster is a problem for Israel, too   Amid flood of refugees to Europe, Italy opens a back door  ", "articleSrc": "WP", "articleBiased": false}, {"articleUrl": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/european-railways-become-ground-zero-for-the-migrant-crisis/2015/09/02/0e7dbe49-b0d0-4fe1-9e86-cf2af4528436_story.html", "articleHeader": "European railways become ground zero for the migrant crisis", "articleText": "\u2009  LONDON \u2014 European railways were ground zero Wednesday in faltering efforts to contain the continent\u2019s burgeoning refugee crisis, with thousands of asylum-seekers camped out at Hungary\u2019s main train station and service between Paris and London disrupted overnight after reports of migrants on the tracks. A day after Hungary temporarily halted rail traffic at Budapest\u2019s central station, at least 2,000 asylum seekers remained locked out, as Hungarian authorities refused to let them travel onward to Austria and Germany. Several hundred staged impromptu demonstrations, shouting \u201cFreedom! Freedom!\u201d and demanding that they be allowed to use the tickets that many had already purchased for hundreds of euros. Riot police looked on warily as the protests continued into the evening. Meanwhile, across the continent, passengers on the Eurostar service between Britain and France were stranded for hours overnight and two trains turned back as authorities searched for migrants who had been reported on the tracks and atop train carriages.   The delays disrupted travel for as many as 2,000 passengers and were the latest in a summer in which migrants have frequently ventured onto tracks near the Channel Tunnel in the French port city of Calais, trying to stow away on trains bound for Britain. The impact on transit systems reflected the scale of the crisis confronting European leaders as hundreds of thousands of refugees have arrived seeking sanctuary from conflict, oppression and poverty in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa. Policymakers have called an emergency summit for Sept.\u00a014 at which European Union leaders are planning to push for a more coordinated effort by the union\u2019s 28 member states. The plans are expected to include a system for dispersing refugees more equitably across the continent, as well as rules for determining which migrants should be returned to their home countries because they fail to meet the definition of refugees. But rights advocates say the E.U. also needs to implement safe and legal routes to the continent to allow refugees to avoid perilous and often deadly journeys.   [Read The Post\u2019s coverage on the global surge in migration]  The latest deaths were reported Wednesday when 12 migrants drowned after two boats capsized in the narrow strait between Turkey and the Greek island of Kos, Turkish police said.   The migrant crisis in Europe is worsening, with thousands flooding into Hungary everyday. Migrants have not been permitted to leave as their paperwork is processed and officials draw up plans to spread them out across Europe. (Reuters)   The deaths highlighted the growing hazards of what had until recently been one of the safer routes to Europe because of the relatively brief sea journey. A photo of a Syrian toddler whose body washed up on the Turkish coast hours after the sinkings circulated widely online. A second photo showed a solemn policeman cradling the boy, who was dressed in a red T-shirt, shorts and sneakers. \u201cDespite only being a few short miles, as we have seen, the open-sea journey from Turkey to Greece is far from safe and will only become more dangerous as the weather turns this autumn,\u201d said Kirk Day, field director for the International Rescue Committee, in a statement. \u201cWith an estimated 200,000 refugees still planning to make the journey to Greece this year, it is inevitable that we will see a further loss of life until Europe\u2019s policies change.\u201d The European border control agency Frontex said 23,000 migrants arrived in Greece last week alone \u2014 a 50\u00a0percent increase over the previous week. The total for the year in Greece is more than 200,000. The vast majority of the migrants have no intention of staying in Greece but plan to travel north through the Balkans, Hungary and Austria to settle in northern European countries such as Germany and Sweden. Germany has said it expects 800,000 asylum applications this year and has called for other countries to take up more of the burden. But British Prime Minister David Cameron signaled Wednesday that his country would not necessarily comply. Britain has resettled just 216 Syrian refugees since the war began, in addition to nearly 5,000 others who have traveled to the island nation on their own. Despite growing pressure from opposition politicians and fellow European leaders for those numbers to be expanded, Cameron said Wednesday that Britain would continue to focus on foreign aid rather than refugee resettlement. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is an answer that can be achieved simply by taking more and more refugees,\u201d he told the BBC.

There was no sign Monday that the crisis was easing, with Britain and France \u2014 two nations criticized for not doing enough \u2014 pledging to take in tens of thousands of asylum seekers. But Germany \u2014 the nation taking in the lion\u2019s share, an estimated 800,000 by year\u2019s end \u2014 continued to lead the way, pledging to hire 3,000 more police officers and spend $6.7\u00a0billion more to address the crisis, including emergency housing for 150,000 people. Yet even as German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her nation should be \u201cproud\u201d of its response, other European leaders and domestic critics blamed Germany, as well as similarly generous nations such as Sweden, for offering benefits so lucrative that they had become an incentive for asylum seekers to risk their lives over land and sea. The sniping came as the pace of arrivals accelerated Monday. In Greece, the refugees\u2019 first port of call, authorities requested emergency European Union assistance as islands received asylum seekers faster than they could be ferried to the mainland. Greece\u2019s coast guard said it had rescued more than 2,000 asylum seekers in the Mediterranean Sea since Friday. And hundreds of migrants scuffled with Hungarian authorities on the border with Serbia before pushing into the country on foot. Germany responded to the criticism Monday by announcing a reduction in cash handouts for asylum seekers during their initial months of processing, instead saying it would offer them more food stamps and in-kind aid. Berlin also said it would push to have western Balkan countries such as Kosovo declared \u201csafe\u201d in a bid to weed out the many thousands of migrants now claiming asylum from countries not at war.        1 of 69       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                                                 Skip Ad   \u00d7           Migrants\u2019 desperate quest to cross into Europe      View Photos   More than 332,000 people have reached Europe so far this year.

Referring to criticisms by European leaders including Britain\u2019s David Cameron and Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban, he said, \u201cI can\u2019t say that Orban or Cameron are completely wrong.\u201d In the crowded refugee centers across this nation of 81\u00a0million, asylum seekers have conceded that they have come to Germany because it is doing more to help than other nations in the region. Mohammed Mazher Alkilany, 28, a former PR consultant for the Damascus tourism board who is living in a temporary shelter in east Berlin, said his family of three is living on 233 euros a month provided by the government \u2014 a sum he described as too little to cover the cost of warm clothes and blankets for the coming winter. But they are also living in free temporary housing in a building outfitted with a playground and rooms with shared kitchens, bathrooms and washing machines. He insisted, though, that he did not come to Germany simply for its generous benefits. \u201cI came here because Germany is safe; there is no war,\u201d he said. \u201cGermany is the best in Europe. France is no good, you cannot get language classes there, but in Germany you can learn the language for free.\u201d Although Sweden is offering similar aid, he said it was \u201ctoo far away, it is very cold, and it is always night there.\u201d A few European nations have been willing to set up operations to legally and safely bring, for example, Syrian refugees directly from bordering nations such as Turkey and Lebanon. But they have put strict limits on numbers, with all 28 E.U. nations offering just over 53,000 such spots since 2013, according to U.N. figures. That is a drop in the ocean compared with the more than 4\u00a0million Syrian refugees.   Instead, European nations have preferred to deal with \u00adasylum seekers only at the point when they are politically forced to \u2014 after the refugees physically cross their borders. Analysts say that a shift in policy would reduce the incentives to make the dangerous voyage to Europe\u2019s shores but that there was little political support for such an effort. Cameron announced Monday that Britain would resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees directly from the Middle East over the next five years \u2014 a figure equal to the number of asylum seekers Germany took in over the weekend. Cameron, however, said Britain was nevertheless acting with \u201chead and heart\u201d by accepting refugees only from camps around the Syrian border, while seemingly taking a jab at nations such as Germany for encouraging illegal trips by accepting so many. \u201cWe want to encourage people not to make that dangerous crossing in the first place,\u201d Cameron said. Up to now, Britain has resettled only 216 Syrian refugees through its government program. The scant opportunities to obtain visas on the ground near the Syrian conflict were dramatized by the drowning death last week of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who had family in Canada but whose parents had been unable to get family reunification visas that would have given them a legal route out of Turkey. Instead, they tried to reach Greece by boat, with tragic consequences. \u201cWe would prefer that no refugee would have to take that dangerous journey to have to reach safety in Europe,\u201d said Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Under a European Commission proposal to be released Wednesday, reception camps would be set up in Italy, Greece and Hungary to route new arrivals to other European countries. That could eliminate most of the risky overland legs of the journey. But the incentives to set sail from Turkey, Libya or Egypt would remain. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande said Monday that his nation stood ready to take in 24,000 refugees as part of the plan. Spain\u2019s El Pais newspaper published leaked numbers that show Germany taking more than 31,000, while Spain would take in nearly 15,000. Other countries would take in far fewer. The debate over whether Germany is being too generous came as more European politicians are questioning the open-door approach. \u201cJust between us, you know, the problem is not a European problem. The problem is a German problem,\u201d Orban said last week after negotiations with E.U. leaders. In France, which has struggled with how to respond to the influx, far-right leader Marine Le Pen took a pot shot at Berlin\u2019s efforts. \u201cGermany is probably thinking of its moribund demographics, and it is probably trying to lower salaries again and to continue to recruit slaves via massive immigration,\u201d she told a meeting of her National Front party. The move in Germany to reduce cash handouts for asylum seekers came as the country is also seeking to rapidly expel those who do not qualify. During the first six months of this year, for instance, about 45\u00a0percent of people seeking asylum in Germany were Europeans from the Balkans. Overall, however, Germany is dramatically ramping up its spending on the crisis, with the nation preparing for years, if not generations, of societal change from the arrival of so many newcomers. \u201cWhat we are experiencing now is something that will continue to preoccupy and change our country in the coming years,\u201d Merkel said Monday. \u201cAnd we want it to change in a positive way.

At a train station in southern Moravia, Czech police pulled 200 refugees off a train and marked numbers on their arms. On its eastern border, Hungary is building a barbed-wire fence to keep out refugees, remarkably like the barbed wire \u201ciron curtain\u201d that once marked its western border. Choose whatever image you want \u2014 ships full of Jews being sent back to Nazi Europe, refugees furtively negotiating with smugglers at a bar in Casablanca \u2014 and it now has a modern twist.

View Archive   Facebook RSS   As happens so often, crocodile tears are falling. The Sun, a British tabloid, has spent a decade railing against immigrants of all kinds. Not long ago, it told the British prime minister to \u201cDraw a Red Line on Immigration \u2014 Or Else.\u201d Now, after the publication of photographs of a dead Syrian toddler washed up on a Turkish beach, it wants him to \u201cDeal With the Worst Crisis Facing Europe Since WW2.\u201d Having just declared that there was no point in accepting \u201cmore and more refugees,\u201d poor David Cameron has now declared that, actually, Britain would accept more and more refugees. His aides hurriedly explained that \u201che had not seen the photographs\u201d when he made the original statement. More layers of hypocrisy: Although the photographs are indeed terrible, they aren\u2019t actually telling us anything new. Refugees have been crossing the Mediterranean for months. Hundreds have died. Also, if we are disturbed by a dead child on a beach, why aren\u2019t we disturbed by another dead child in a bombed-out house in Aleppo, Syria? What\u2019s the distinction? Even now, almost all of the slogans being bandied about as \u201csolutions\u201d are based on false assumptions. Nations should accept real refugees but not economic migrants? For one, it\u2019s rarely easy to tell the difference. More to the point, the number of potentially \u201clegitimate\u201d refugees is staggeringly high. As of July, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees had registered more than 4\u2009million Syrian refugees, of whom well over a million are in Turkey and 1.5 million are in Lebanon, a country of only 4.8\u2009million people. That\u2019s not counting Iraqis, Libyans, Afghans and others who have equally suffered political or religious persecution, or even the millions of displaced Syrians still in Syria. Exactly how many of them will Europe take? It gets worse: The law says refugees should \u201cdeclare themselves in the first European Union country they enter\u201d and then apply for asylum according to E.U. law. That\u2019s all very well for, say, Ireland. But what happens when tens of thousands of people board boats in Tripoli and start heading for Italy or Greece? Now we know: Those two countries have been pleading for assistance from their neighbors for many months, to no avail. And when Hungary can\u2019t cope with the numbers? We\u2019ve just learned: The refugees become a prop for Viktor Orban , the Hungarian prime minister, who has a fondness for dramatic scenes. Orban was correct in one of his inflammatory statements: The refugees don\u2019t want to stay in Hungary. They want to go to Germany, mostly because the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has made sympathetic noises, has offered to take more Syrians and has called on others to do the same. The Hungarians, by contrast, have greeted refugees with pepper spray and made them camp out at the Budapest train station (For history buffs, another irony: At one point, refugees started chanting \u201cGermany, Germany!\u201d) But if those praising Merkel\u2019s \u201cbrave\u201d stance were honest, they would acknowledge that she isn\u2019t offering any long-term solutions either. Even if Europe does take another couple of hundred thousand people, dividing them up among countries \u2014 as it should \u2014 that won\u2019t prevent others from coming. To avoid accusations of heartlessness, the Italian coast guard rescues thousands of people from tiny boats and rubber dinghies. As a result, people keep taking the terrible risk. Here is what no one wants to say: This is, in essence, a security crisis. For years now, Europeans have chosen to pretend that wars taking place in Syria and Libya were somebody else\u2019s problem. It\u2019s also a foreign policy crisis: At different times and for different reasons, all of the large European states \u2014 Britain, France, Italy, Germany \u2014 have blocked attempts to create a common foreign and defense policy, and as a result they have no diplomatic or political clout. They haven\u2019t wanted European leadership, and most of them wouldn\u2019t have wanted U.S. leadership either, even if any had been on offer. The richest economy in the world has a power vacuum at its heart and no army. Now the consequences are literally washing up on Europe\u2019s shores.
