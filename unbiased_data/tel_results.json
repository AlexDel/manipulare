[{"articleText": " \n When the crew of HMS Bulwark first fished immigrants out of the Mediterranean, they were expecting to find the world\u2019s hungry, wretched and destitute. Instead, they found them relatively healthy, well-dressed and carrying mobile phones and credit cards, which they intended to use upon arrival in Italy.  \u2022 EU refugee crisis: latest news and updates  The military learnt then what politicians are only slowly beginning to work out \u2013 that this is not simply a refugee crisis. The world\u2019s poor are on the move because they\u2019re not quite so poor as they used to be, and can afford to travel.

Many are fleeing war, but many are fleeing poverty. The Royal Navy found a pregnant Nigerian woman who had paid $1,200 for the journey and a father from Faisalabad, an industrial city in Pakistan.  Under European rules, they would be judged by whether they were fleeing war or poverty \u2013 but the distinction seems moot. All were prepared to risk death to give their families a better life; seeking only the right to start at the very bottom.

Never has there been less violence: the Syrian conflict is an exception in a period of history where war has waned. It might not feel like it, but the world is more prosperous and peaceful than at any time in human history \u2013 yet the number of emigrants stands at a record high. But there is no paradox. As more people have the money to move, more are doing so \u2013 and at extraordinary personal risk.  .tg-pullquote__global__group{zoom: 1;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:before, .tg-pullquote__global__group:after{content: \"\"; display: table;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:after{clear: both;}.tg-pullquote__inline{float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content{margin: 0 20px 10px 0px; font-size:18px; line-height:23px; font-family:georgia; width:260px; float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content--mobile{float: none; font-size: 18px; margin-left: 4.687%; margin-right: 4.687%; width: 90.626%;}.tg-pullquote__title{font-family:arial; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px; border-top:1px dotted #000000;}.tg-pullquote__quote{color:#007A8F; font-style:italic; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__attribution{color:#787878; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__source{}.tg-pullquote__source__link{color:#234B7B; outline:0; text-decoration:none;}.tg-pullquote__source__link:hover{border-bottom: 1px dotted #122842; color: #122842;}.tg-pullquote__share{float:right;}.tg-pullquote__share--icon{background-image:url(\"http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.png\"); background-image: url(\"http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.svg\"), none; width:26px; height:26px;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink{border-bottom:none;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink:hover{border-bottom:none !important;}.tg-pullquote__share--twitter{margin-right:5px;}.tg-pullquote__share--facebook{background-position: 26px 0;}\n\n\n    \"A photograph of a drowned child is heartbreaking, but should not change policy: a botched response can lead to many more dead children.

The Washington-based Center for Global Development recently set this out, in a study drawing on more than a thousand national censuses over five decades.  When a poor country becomes richer, its emigration rate rises until it becomes as wealthy as Albania or Armenia are today. This process usually takes decades, and only afterwards does wealth subdue emigration. War is a catalyst. If conflict strikes, and the country isn\u2019t quite as poor as it once was, more of those affected now have the means to cross the world. The digital age means they also have the information.  When the world was poorer, Europe could be pretty relaxed about immigration laws. The British Nationality Act of 1948 declared that all 600 million of the King\u2019s subjects had the right to settle in Britain \u2013 which, today, seems like lunacy. But then, no one cared: very few of those subjects had the means (or inclination) to migrate to our cold, depopulating island.  Even after shocks like the partition of India, which claimed a million souls and displaced at least 10 times as many, Britain was not deluged with immigration applications. In 1951, we signed the UN Refugee Convention promising to shelter anyone with a \u201cwell-founded fear of persecution.\u201d Wars kept being waged, but newcomers arrived at the rate of 100 a day.  Now, they\u2019re arriving at 1,500 a day. Globalisation has transformed the global movement of people, as well as goods and money \u2013 and Britain handles this perhaps better than any country in Europe. We are one of the few countries in the world where unemployment rates for immigrants are no higher than for natives, and where there is no far-Right party causing havoc in Parliament.  We impose fairly tough rules (we even deport Frenchmen who don\u2019t work) but Britain is now the most successful melting pot in Europe. The countries currently urging us to take on more asylum seekers are, by and large, the same ones who are in crisis after accepting more than they have been able to handle.  If you misjudge the refugee crisis, you incubate a political crisis: this is the lesson that David Cameron has learnt. Efforts intended to help can end up causing harm, costing more lives. Since the Italian navy decided to send rescue missions to the Mediterranean, the number of people making the crossing (and perishing) has trebled.  Doubtless Angela Merkel meant well when she invited every Syrian to apply for asylum in Germany. But she will be toasted by the new breed of people traffickers, who will now have far more families to extort and leave stranded in Budapest or pack into boats on the coast of Libya.  Who will weep for the child victims of the conflict in Yemen?\u00a0 Photo: Saleh Al-Obeidi/AFP/Getty Images A photograph of a drowned child is heartbreaking, but should not change policy: a botched response can lead to many more dead children. Hundreds of Yemeni children will likely starve this winter, victims of its civil war \u2013 we won\u2019t see the pictures, so we\u2019re unlikely to see anyone petitioning Parliament about them. But it\u2019s no less of a tragedy. There is, of course, more that Britain could and should do for Syrians; even taking 10,000, as Yvette Cooper suggests, is manageable for a country that absorbs this number of immigrants every week. But let\u2019s not pretend our doing so will help the rest of Syria\u2019s four million registered refugees.  The Great Migration is a 21st century problem, far bigger than Syria and bigger than the authorities in Brussels seem able to comprehend. To panic now, as Mrs Merkel is doing, will just bring more to panic about. The solutions of the last century \u2013 refugee camps, or the notion that you can stem the flow of migrants with foreign aid \u2013 need to be abandoned, and a new agenda needs to be forged. Europe, in short, needs to begin a new conversation. Given that David Cameron is one of the few people in Europe keeping his head throughout this crisis, he\u2019s the ideal man to start it.   \n\n", "articleSrc": "TEL", "articleHeader": "Prepare yourselves: The Great Migration will be with us for decades", "articleUrl": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11842760/Prepare-yourselves-The-Great-Migration-will-be-with-us-for-decades.html", "articleBiased": false}, {"articleText": " \n The migration crisis is a \u201cGerman problem\u201d, Viktor Orban, the hardline prime minister of Hungary declared today, as he attacked EU asylum quotas as an \u201cinvitation\u201d and insisted he was protecting Europe's Christian heritage from Muslims.  \"The problem is not a European problem, the problem is a German problem,\" said Orban.  \"Nobody wants to stay in Hungary, neither in Slovakia, nor Poland, nor Estonia. All want to go to Germany. Our job is just to register them.\"  \u2022 Britain can't solve the refugee crisis alone  \u2022 'David Cameron is placing himself on the wrong side of history'  Orban was speaking as hundreds of refugees and migrants stormed a train at Budapest's reopened main international railway station, which has become a bottleneck for people trying to head to western Europe via Hungary.  Orban, appearing with European Parliament president Martin Schulz, said he would impose a new package of measures by September 15 to cope with the crisis.  He was speaking after claiming in a German newspaper that Europe faces \"explosive\" consequences of an influx of Muslims.  \u201cEverything which is now taking place before our eyes threatens to have explosive consequences for the whole of Europe,\u201d Orban wrote in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. \u201cEurope\u2019s response is madness. We must acknowledge that the European Union\u2019s misguided immigration policy is responsible for this situation.  Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban\u00a0 Photo: Rex \u201cThose arriving have been raised in another religion, and represent a radically different culture. Most of them are not Christians, but Muslims,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is an important question, because Europe and European identity is rooted in Christianity. Is it not worrying in itself that European Christianity is now barely able to keep Europe Christian? There is no alternative, and we have no option but to defend our borders.\u201d  \u201cIrresponsibility is the mark of every European politician who holds out the promise of a better life to immigrants and encourages them to leave everything behind and risk their lives in setting out for Europe. If Europe does not return to the path of common sense, it will find itself laid low in a battle for its fate.\u201d  Orban said the EU should tell people \u201cnot to come\u201d and said that the EU redistribution quotas were an \u201cinvitation\u201d.  \"We Hungarians are full of fear, people in Europe are full of fear because they see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation,\" Orban during the press conference.

There was chaos at Keleti station in Budapest on Thursday morning after the police abandoned a two-day blockade of the terminal, allowing migrants camped out in the subterranean concourse outside to rush inside in the hope of catching a train to Germany or other parts of Western Europe.  Families sleep underneath the Keleti train station in Budapest, Hungary\u00a0 Photo: Eyevine Believing a train was heading for Munich, hundreds of people pushed and shoved their way onto a train as the few remaining police officers in the station area stood by.  Platform 8 of the station became the scene of dangerous overcrowding and screams could be heard as confusion reigned amongst migrants as to where the train was heading, despite the signs on the carriage doors saying it was a service only as far as Sopron, a town in Hungary close to the border with Austria.  Scuffles broke out inside the train and families with small children were among those trying to squeeze their way inside and escape the de facto refugee which had formed outside Keleti, where around 2,000 people have slept on the floor over recent nights.  The information board in the station put up a notice saying that al international services to Western Europe had been cancelled for safety reasons. Loudspeaker announcements asked people to get off the train for Sopron due to overcrowding. Eventually, after the train\u2019s scheduled departure at 10.10 passed, many migrants gave up as they realised they would not be able to cross the border and leave Hungary.  No station staff were present on the platform or at the entrances to the station. A queue built up at customer services, where station staff explained to backpackers why they could not take direct trains towards Vienna or other European destinations today. A station official said that the border with Slovakia was closed and that trains heading towards Germany would all be stopping before the border, meaning onward passengers would have to change.  Hundreds of migrants remain inside Keleti station. \n.global__group{zoom:1}.global__group:after,.global__group:before{content:'';display:table}.global__group:after{clear:both}.float--left{display:-moz-inline-stack;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;zoom:1}.timeline__container.is__mobile{padding-left:4.687%;padding-right:4.687%}.timeline__title{margin-bottom:20px}.timeline__title__headline{font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:24px;line-height:28px;color:#CC0000;margin-bottom:15px}.timeline__title__subtitle{-webkit-font-smoothing:antialiased;font-family:'Telesans Text Web';font-size:15px;line-height:21px;color:#565656}.timeline__main{-webkit-font-smoothing:antialiased;font-family:'Telesans Text Web';position:relative;color:#565656;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.timeline__element{background-color:#F4F4F0;padding:15px 20px 20px 35px}.timeline__element+.timeline__element{margin-top:3px}.timeline__element__leftCont{margin-right:10px;width:13px;height:15px}.timeline__element__bar{height:100%;width:1px;background-color:#777}.timeline__element__title{position:relative;margin-bottom:10px}.timeline__element__title:after{width:13px;height:13px;background-image:url(http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/TimelineGenerator/img/diamond.png);content:'';left:-25px;position:absolute;top:2px}.timeline__element__subtitle{font-size:18px;font-weight:700;line-height:21px;margin-bottom:10px}.timeline__element__date{font-weight:700}.timeline__element__time{color:#CC0000}.timeline__element__media__image{width:100%;max-width:620px}.timeline__element__media__image image{display:block}.video--container{position:relative;width:100%;max-width:620px;margin-bottom:5px}.video--player{padding-bottom:56.27%}.video--player .innerWrapper{width:auto!important;height:auto!important;position:absolute!important;top:0;right:0;left:0;bottom:0}.timeline__element__media__caption{font-size:13px;color:#777;margin-bottom:20px}.timeline__element__text+.timeline__element__title{margin-top:25px}.timeline__bar{position:absolute;top:0;left:16px;height:100%;width:1px}.timeline__bar__fill{position:absolute;height:auto;bottom:0;top:0;left:0;right:0;margin-top:20px;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;background-color:#777;width:100%}.video--container__ooyala--padding{width:100%;padding-bottom:56.25%;position:relative}.video--container__ooyala{position:absolute;top:0;bottom:0;left:0;right:0}\n\n\n\n     Migrant crisis - the last six months \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n       19 April, 2015 \n     \n\n       650 migrants feared dead \n     \n\n\n      Around 650 migrants were feared drowned as a boat carrying 700 capsized in the waters of the Italian island of Lampedusa.

The German Chancellor took a huge political gamble this week by tearing up the EU\u2019s rulebook, while also demanding a new deal that would force Britain to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees.  Faced with a human flood, Mrs Merkel has abandoned the Dublin Convention that requires asylum-seekers to be processed in their country of arrival. Berlin\u2019s new policy will allow Syrian refugees to apply for asylum in Germany, rather than in their first port of call.  Deciding to do such a thing without the approval of Brussels will surely encourage other EU countries to pursue their own migration policies, too. But this is the last thing Mrs Merkel wants. She and President Hollande of France have just called for a new, binding European agreement to share the asylum burden.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives prior her visit to a refugee shelter that was attacked by far-right protesters over the weekend in Heidenau, eastern Germany, Wednesday, Aug. 26, 2015 Her proposals, however, were greeted with incredulity by other member states, their inherent flaw being that they would give millions more migrants an added incentive to come to Europe. Mr Cameron, along with other leaders, is resisting Mrs Merkel\u2019s move, despite moral blackmail from EU and UN officials.  Mrs Merkel may not like it but many Germans, who are expecting a record 800,000 asylum-seekers this year, feel that they have already taken more than their fair share. They blame their coalition government for being a soft touch and street protests are reaching a crescendo. On Thursday, Mrs Merkel was greeted by angry protests and shouts of \u201ctraitor\u201d as she visited an embattled refugee hostel near Dresden. Solving this crisis is proving to be the greatest challenge of her career.  The consensus in Berlin is that Europe\u2019s combination of open borders and different national immigration policies is unsustainable. The present uncontrolled influx is not how the system is designed to work \u2013 but the scale of the exodus from the Muslim world means that rules are being flouted as each country protects its own interest.  Meanwhile, the lack of border controls within Europe is allowing migrants to make for countries with generous rules on asylum and welfare, especially Germany and the UK. Britain, with a strong economy, is a powerful draw for migrants but we are outside the borderless Schengen area and Theresa May is determined to keep asylum seekers out of the UK. Unsurprisingly, the German media is portraying the Tory government as selfish.  The blame game is, however, as pointless as it is undemocratic. The British public will not accept an EU policy that imposes quotas of migrants without our consent. Nor will most other countries \u2013 including Germany. So the EU\u2019s asylum system is buckling and everywhere support is surging for extremist parties of Left and Right. \n\n\ntmgAds.embedPlayer = tmgAds.embedPlayer || {};\ntmgAds.embedPlayer = {width:620,height:349,size:'620x349',vidSize:'620x415'};\nif(typeof(tmgAds.page.platform) != 'undefined' && tmgAds.page.platform === \"mobile\") tmgAds.embedPlayer = {width:300,height:169,size:'300x169',vidSize:'300x235'};\ntmgAds.embedPlayer = {\n  'targetId'     : 'embedPlayerWrapper',\n  'platform'     : tmgAds.page.platform,\n  'width'        : tmgAds.embedPlayer.width,\n  'height'       : tmgAds.embedPlayer.height,\n  'size'         : tmgAds.embedPlayer.size,\n  'autoplay'     : 'false',\n  'vidEmbed'     : 'VjaTk0dzrUiXq-OrsFtwoVlNEuXJBomp',\n  'adTag'        : tmgAdsBuildAdTag(\"vid\",tmgAds.embedPlayer.vidSize,\"pfadx\",\";vidsrc=tmg;vt=embed;dcmt=text/xml\",3)\n}\ntmgAds.embedPlayer.remotesrc = 'http://s.telegraph.co.uk/tmgads/tools/ooyala/iframeplayer.html?platform='+tmgAds.page.platform+'&width='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.width+'&height='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.height+'&size='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.size+'&vidEmbed='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.vidEmbed+'&adTag='+encodeURIComponent(tmgAds.embedPlayer.adTag);\ntmgAds.embedPlayer.tmgEmbedPlayer = '<iframe src=\"'+tmgAds.embedPlayer.remotesrc+'&adobeDTM=live\" width=\"'+tmgAds.embedPlayer.width+'\" height=\"'+tmgAds.embedPlayer.height+'\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>';\ndocument.write(tmgAds.embedPlayer.tmgEmbedPlayer);\n\n Mrs Merkel, European figurehead, has the experience and authority to restore order to the anarchy. And Mr Cameron has hitherto enjoyed the best relationship with the chancellor of any European leader. He has, moreover, a direct interest in reforming the EU\u2019s migration regime as it is bound to loom large in the coming referendum.  So will the British and German governments make common cause? They should, but they face very different challenges. Mr Cameron wants to restore national control over migration from inside the EU, while Mrs Merkel wants European control of migration from outside Europe.  Their first priority must be to stabilise the crisis that began with the fallout from the Syrian civil war. That would require the EU to impose much stricter external border controls, while helping Mediterranean countries, the first ports of call, to accommodate asylum-seekers and process their applications. Mrs Merkel has promised to do more to help Greece and Italy cope, and today she will attend a summit in Vienna, where Balkan countries will also demand aid, especially Macedonia, which has declared a state of emergency.  The next step would be to restore a measure of national sovereignty to the larger question of economic migration. Mrs Merkel refuses to compromise on the principle of free movement, but she could show more flexibility by allowing each country to interpret that principle in its own way.  Right now, she faces a stark choice between nation states acting independently or the creation of Fortress Europe. Either the EU permits the restoration of national control over immigration \u2013 which means the end of free movement within Europe \u2013 or the EU turns itself into a fortress, excluding genuine refugees as well as economic migrants, while preserving its internal freedom of movement. It will not be lost on older readers that \u201cFortress Europe\u201d \u2013 Festung Europa \u2013 was Hitler\u2019s name for Nazi-occupied Europe. Such a reactionary idea would be impractical as well as deeply unpopular.  window['cf697204-e227-4d24-a30f-9ed7beae103c'] = {'yLabel':'Population','valuePrefix':'','valueSuffix':'','includeZero':false,'dateFormat':'DD/MM/YYYY','percent':false,'enableSpillover':false};Foreign-born population of the UK\n\n\n\n\n\nEU-born\nNon EU-born\n\n\n\n\n2004\n1491000\n3767000\n\n\n2005\n1584000\n3996000\n\n\n2006\n1778000\n4256000\n\n\n2007\n1987000\n4421000\n\n\n2008\n2136000\n4633000\n\n\n2009\n2215000\n4806000\n\n\n2010\n2314000\n4920000\n\n\n2011\n2564000\n5097000\n\n\n2012\n2652000\n5170000\n\n\n2013\n2743000\n5178000\n\n\n\n\n  Meanwhile, having unilaterally abrogated the Dublin Convention, Mrs Merkel can hardly expect other countries to accept an EU diktat, especially if it obliges them to absorb migrants in very large numbers. So perhaps Europe would indeed do better to adopt a more empirical, every-man-for-himself solution, giving states free rein to decide for themselves how to deal with migration. It is pretty much what Germany is doing now.  But this would of course have serious implications for the European project and its very identity. What should Europe be? Inclusive and engaged with the world? Or exclusive and protectionist?  This gathering storm will test the idea of European integration \u2013 as well as leaders\u2019 political careers \u2013 to destruction. As the crisis boosts the British \u201cNo\u201d campaign, the prospect of Brexit should enable Mr Cameron to drive a harder bargain in his renegotiation, if he truly wants it. But equally, public opinion will harden further against him and Europe if he lets the crisis escalate much further.  After all, if Europe cannot make up its mind about who counts as a European, what is the point of belonging to the EU?

Danish police announced on Thursday that they would no longer detain refugees aiming to travel through the country to Sweden, after days of chaos at its borders with Germany as security forces tried to curb the rising inflow. 3,200 people have entered the country since Sunday as a wave of migrants, many of them Syrian, pushes north through Europe in the hope of refuge.  Sweden\u2019s prime minister, Stefan Lofven, attacked Denmark\u2019s \u201cunfortunate decision\u201d to send trains onward to its neighbour without attempting to register anyone on board, as the pressure of the greatest refugee crisis since the Second World War pushed EU asylum rules to breaking point.  \u201cThis is an unfortunate decision,\u201d Mr Lofven said. \u201cThe Dublin Regulation says that the country which refugees first come to is the country where the should be registered. This is how we act in Sweden, and we intend to follow the rules.\u201d  Refugees sit in a train headed to Sweden as it leaves Copenhagen Central Station\u00a0 Photo: REUTERS/Linda Kastrup/Scanpix Danish security forces had briefly closed a major ferry and rail crossing after a standoff at the port of Rodby with two trains carrying 350 refugees demanding to be allowed through to Sweden, but re-opened it on Wednesday, as well as a motorway link which had been shut on and off over recent days.  A temporary asylum centre set up to register asylum seekers in Rodby has now been closed, with refugees left to travel on by train unhindered.  The country\u2019s national train operator DSB said on Thursday it was now allowing refugees to travel through the country for free.  Jens Henrik Hojberg, Denmark\u2019s national police commissioner, said that the authorities had been forced to stop trying to register all refugees, as they lacked the resources.  \u201cWe obviously cannot not keep so many people in detention indefinitely, so there is no other option than to leave them at liberty, and therefore we cannot prevent them from travelling wherever they want,\u201d he said.  According to the Danish Ministry of Justice, just 400 of the refugees who have crossed over into Denmark since Sunday have applied for asylum in the country.  \u201cThe large majority of the arrivals have refused to communicate with Danish authorities,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cMost of those who have had contact with the Danish police have stated that they want to go to Sweden to claim asylum.\u201d  Sweden expects to receive 80,000 refugees this year and has more asylum seekers per capita than any other European nation thanks to a generous immigration policy allowing automatic permanent residency for Syrians.

Austrian railways ordered all train services to and from Hungary stopped on Thursday after what it described as \u201cmassive overcrowding\u201d by refugees, while Macedonia said it was now considering building a Hungarian-style border fence.  More than 3,000 refugees arrived overnight at the Nickelsdorf im Burgenland rail border crossing, according to police in Austria.  By 10.30am there were 3,700 refugees crowded into the border station, with thousands more on their way from Hungary.  Buses and shuttle trains taking the arriving refugees on to Vienna were unable to cope with the numbers and the Austrian army was deployed to the station to keep order.  The Austrian railway company OeBB said in a statement it had no choice but to temporarily suspend service \u201cbecause of massive overcrowding on trains arriving from Hungary\u201d.  The company added it was selling no more tickets to Hungary.  \u201cWe don\u2019t know how many refugees we have to prepare ourselves for,\u201d Christian Stella, deputy director of the Burgenland state police, told Krone newspaper.  Around 1,500 were expected on a train from the Hungarian town of Gyor, he said.  In Budapest, there were reports of police cordons holding back crowds of some 2,000 refugees who wanted to board trains to Austria.  Some 3,300 refugees crossed from Serbia into Hungary after having made their way through the country from Macedonia, according to Serbian reports, while there were another 4,000 massed in the Serbian border town of Kanjiza.  Macedonian Foreign Minister Nikola Poposki said on Thursday that a fence or an army deployment may be necessary to secure the country's border with Greece.  In an interview with Hungarian business weekly Figyelo, he said Macedonia will probably also need \u201csome kind of a physical defence\u201d though this would not be a long-term solution.  \u201cBut if we take seriously what Europe is asking us to do, we will need that, too. Either soldiers or a fence or a combination of the two,\u201d he said. \n\n", "articleSrc": "TEL", "articleHeader": "Denmark becomes latest migration flashpoint as it gives refugees free passage to Sweden", "articleUrl": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/sweden/11857145/Denmark-becomes-latest-migration-flashpoint-as-it-gives-refugees-free-passage-to-Sweden.html", "articleBiased": false}, {"articleText": " \n Dressed only in a thin white polo shirt and jeans, Ashraf, a 17-year-old from Damascus, shivers in the rain next to the dense Serbo-Hungarian forest where he has lived without food and water for three days.

According to government statistics, they were among at least 61,000 migrants who have entered Hungary this year, up sharply from 43,000 in all of 2014.

Its government wants to ensure that Ashraf is among the last to enter the country via this route. Hungary \u2013 the first nation to dismantle its borders before the collapse of Communism in 1989 \u2013 is planning to erect a 110-mile long, 13ft-high barbed wire fence along its border with Serbia. The plan has outraged the United Nations and the EU.

Viktor Orb\u00e1n, the populist Hungarian prime minister, has been among the harshest critics \u2013 along with Britain \u2013 of EU plans to manage the upsurge in migrant numbers by spreading the burden around the 28-nation bloc.   17-year-old Ashraf (Andras D Hajdu/The Telegraph)   Ashraf was one of 1,141 refugees, including 106 children apprehended by police officers in Csongr\u00e1d county, south Hungary, last Wednesday. The Telegraph witnessed the capture of around 200 Syrian migrants in the forests of Hattyas, near the southern Hungarian town of Szeged. A policeman at the scene said a picture published by the AFP agency had alerted them to the whereabouts of the migrants in the forest, after which around 100 officers were scrambled.  Among those held is Abdul, a 22-year-old banking and finance graduate, and his brother Adel \u2014 both former members of the middle-classes of Damascus.  Abdul says: \u201cAfter I left Syria, I worked in Istanbul as a waiter for seven months, but if you are Syrian they pay you three times less for doing the same job.

A housewife who lives in the nearby village of Gy\u00e1lar\u00e9t says she gets up at 4am every morning to water and hoe her garden. Around two weeks ago, she began to see lines of people walking silently down her street. At first, she was scared by such an unusual sight, but after a few more glances she was struck by how worn out and desperate they looked. Then she noticed their children, clinging sleepily to their mothers. After a couple of days some people in the village started to put out buckets of water and food in front of their porches.   A migrant family sleeps on the street after being released by Szeged police (Andras D Hajdu/The Telegraph)   Ashraf says he and his father were among around 200 refugees who went on hunger strike in Gazi Baba refugee camp in the Macedonian capital of Skopje, to protest against the inhumane treatment.  When back on the road, \u201cour group met mafia guys in Macedonia. They hit some of us here\u201d, Ashraf says, pointing towards his head. As they neared Hungary, four men with knives and stun guns, dressed as Serbian policemen, threatened them and took their money. Then they crossed the River Tisza into Hungary and the forest.  Another two groups of around 80 people are caught over the next hour. They huddle under a waterproof sheet provided by the police. A pair of Syrian men in their early twenties make a run for it, sprinting back towards the forest. They outrun the guards and disappear from sight, but are brought back around 20 minutes later, this time in handcuffs.   Migrants warm up in a disused brick factory nicknamed The Jungle (Andras D Hajdu/The Telegraph)   After two hours in the heavy rain, a white minibus arrives to take the women and children to a refugee camp in a nearby hangar.  For those planning a border jump from northern Serbia, and with the money to pay for it, there are several hostels operating in Kanizsa. For those without there is The Jungle: a disused brick factory just over the border, on the outskirts of the Serbian town of Subotica.  On arrival at The Jungle we see half a dozen Afghan boys gathered around a well. One crouches precariously on the edge. Another holds up a phone that serves as a makeshift shaving mirror. The complex behind them is composed of several long, derelict red brick buildings. Behind the buildings a creaky train passes a giant refuse heap. The 65ft red brick tower completes the godforsaken look, which brings to mind the darkest chapter of 20th-century Europe.   The disused brick factory on the outskirts of the Serbian town of Subotica (Andras D Hajdu/The Telegraph)   Few of the hundreds of Afghans here speak English, but one manages to explain that he has made it this far with a combination of buses, cheap flights and the well-trod route to Serbia via Turkey, Greece and Macedonia. Several of the men \u2013 there are only men here \u2013 say that the Serbian police turn up twice a day to ask for ID, and demand a \u20ac50 (\u00a335) bribe from those without papers.  In the fields behind the complex, a Kurd from Iraq silently scribbles some Farsi into my notebook.

They tell migrants \u201cIf you come to Hungary, do not take the jobs of Hungarians\u201d and \u201cIf you come to Hungary, you must respect our culture.\u201d  However, as they are written in the notoriously difficult Hungarian language, it seems these are not meant for the migrants, but for Hungarian citizens.

Though many are complaining that Angela Merkel\u2019s willingness to take up to 800,000 asylum seekers in one year has made matters worse by offering hope to others \u2013 and, therefore, encouragement. In public, Germany\u2019s establishment is trying to occupy the high ground, chiding those who refuse to welcome the world\u2019s huddled masses. But there has been violence: in Berlin, asylum centres have been set alight, Right-wing protestors clash with police. Aside from the pressures on schools and hospitals that unmanaged migration brings, moderates also have to consider the danger of rising xenophobia. If rational men and women do not address this problem, reckless demagogues will.   Of course, these demagogues are to be found on the Left as well as the Right. They typically share an opinion that if Britain withdrew further from the world, then the world would leave it alone: end the wars and you end the flow of humanity. This is bad logic. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the two largest groups of people crossing the Mediterranean are from Afghanistan and Syria. Afghanistan was unstable before the West drove the Taliban from power. It has only become more unstable since the West left. \n\nStrikes in Syria are meaningless if we keep slashing our military\n The Syrian civil war certainly has nothing to do with the West. On the contrary, it has arguably been prolonged by a lack of international action \u2013 the British Parliament voted against military intervention in 2013. Even today, it is not known whether Labour would formally lend its backing to military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Jeremy Corbyn and the hard Left tendency argue that intervention would make the crisis worse. It is hard to imagine how. Since 2011, 12 million Syrians have been displaced from their homes and four million forced to flee abroad. They leave behind a dystopia in which the Syrian government kills its own citizens and the rebel army butchers non-believers. The lesson of the past 10 years is that if Britain tries to withdraw from the world, then the world will arrive at its doorstep pleading for help.

The EU cannot cope with the magnitude of this flood and the fantasy that it can will only attract more people, leading to yet more tragedy. Europeans are probably in the mood to reconsider the Schengen principle, while the awful scenes in Austria prove the need to invest in law enforcement. Western leaders must also acknowledge that what is taking place is not unique but that it is bound to continue, which is all the more reason to do more to re-establish control now. Will Europe be ready for another crisis next summer? For the sake of its own citizens and for the desperate refugees, it must be better prepared. \n\n", "articleSrc": "TEL", "articleHeader": "Europe must regain control of migration to end this tragedy", "articleUrl": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/11831889/Europe-must-regain-control-of-migration-to-end-this-tragedy.html", "articleBiased": false}]
