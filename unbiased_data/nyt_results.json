[{"articleText": " Some European officials may be tempted to adopt the hard-line approach Australia has used to stem a similar tide of migrants. That would be unconscionable. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has overseen a ruthlessly effective effort to stop boats packed with migrants, many of them refugees, from reaching Australia\u2019s shores. His policies have been inhumane, of dubious legality and strikingly at odds with the country\u2019s tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war. Since 2013, Australia has deployed its navy to turn back boats with migrants, including asylum seekers, before they could get close to its shores. Military personnel force vessels carrying people from Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Eritrea and other conflict-roiled nations toward Indonesia, where most of the journeys begin. A boat captain recently reported that Australian authorities paid him $30,000 to turn back. If true, that account, which the Australian government has not disputed, would represent a violation of international laws designed to prevent human smuggling and protect asylum seekers. Those who have not been turned back are held at detention centers run by private contractors on nearby islands, including the tiny nation of Nauru. A report this week by an Australian Senate committee portrayed the Nauru center as a purgatory where children are sexually abused, guards give detainees marijuana in exchange for sex and some asylum seekers are so desperate that they stitch their lips shut in an act of protest. Instead of stopping the abuses, the Australian government has sought to hide them from the world. The Border Force Act, which took effect July 1, makes it a crime punishable by a two-year prison sentence for employees at detention camps to discuss the conditions there publicly. Australia and Nauru, which depends heavily on Australian foreign aid, have gone to great lengths to keep international journalists from gaining access to the detention center, in which more than 2,200 people have been held since 2012. Last year, Nauru raised the fee it charges for journalists\u2019 visas from $200 to roughly $8,000; applicants who are turned down are not given refunds. Scores of people who have worked at the camp have become whistle-blowers. More than 40, including medical personnel and social workers, wrote a public letter to senior government officials in July saying they would rather risk arrest than stay quiet. \u201cIf we witness child abuse in Australia we are legally obliged to report it to child protection authorities,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIf we witness child abuse in detention centers, we can go to prison for attempting to advocate for them effectively.\u201d European officials have traveled to Australia on fact-finding missions recently. Mr. Abbott, who argues that aggressively intercepting the boats saves lives, has urged European governments to follow his model, and some European leaders seem so inclined. \u201cThe Australian model may seem attractive to politicians,\u201d said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration. \u201cPoliticians love fences, but what fences do is create a market for smugglers and major humanitarian problems.\u201d The world\u2019s war zones are all but certain to continue to churn out an extraordinary number of refugees and economic migrants in the years ahead. Those people understandably will head to the most prosperous nations, hoping to rebuild their lives. It is inexcusable that some find themselves today in situations that are more hopeless and degrading than the ones that prompted them to flee.", "articleHeader": "Australia\u2019s Brutal Treatment of Migrants  ", "articleBiased": false, "articleSrc": "NYT", "articleUrl": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/03/opinion/australias-brutal-treatment-of-migrants.html?_r=0"}, {"articleText": " Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission and the highest official of the European Union, has laid out a plan to  distribute 160,000 refugees among E.U. members by mandatory quotas. It is a plan Europe simply must adopt if it is to get a handle on the crisis and remain true to its history and values. There is no question that this calamity is without a simple solution. About half a million people have already entered Europe this year and hundreds of thousands more are poised to follow from the Middle East and North Africa. But Europe\u2019s disarray and incompetence in the face of the flood of refugees has only made matters worse, wreaking havoc in front-line countries like Greece, Italy and Hungary and chaos all along the routes taken by refugees trying to reach a safe haven. Many Europeans have reacted with individual compassion, and Germany and Sweden have been exemplary in accepting large numbers of refugees. But the shocking image of a Hungarian camerawoman deliberately tripping a man fleeing from the police has become the icon of a nasty backlash in many parts of Europe against the mass migration, with refugee camps set ablaze and xenophobic demagogues railing against an \u201cIslamic invasion.\u201d However great the crisis, it should not have come to this. It should not have come as a surprise: Four million Syrians fleeing the civil war in their country have long overwhelmed refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, while boatloads of miserable people have been risking death to cross the Mediterranean for years. It was certainly within the ability of a rich and united Europe to manage. Mr. Juncker\u2019s proposal is hardly a panacea, and would still leave hundreds of thousands of refugees in Europe seeking a place to go. But it represents an approach the E.U. should have adopted from the very outset. As Mr. Juncker noted, the 160,000 represents a mere 0.11 percent of the the union\u2019s total population, and the newcomers could be the infusion of youth and energy that an aging Europe needs. Adopting this relatively modest plan of action is essential not only for self-evident humanitarian reasons, but also to reverse the threat to the very survival of the E.U. and its system of open borders. That is a point Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has emerged as the strongest European voice for united and compassionate action, has repeatedly stressed. Resistance to Mr. Juncker\u2019s proposal is certain. Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, has shamefully argued for keeping out the mainly Muslim refugees \u201cto keep Europe Christian,\u201d and several other nations have resisted any quotas. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has declared he will not participate in Mr. Juncker\u2019s plan, and will accept only 20,000 Syrians over the next five years, who will come directly from Middle Eastern camps. When European interior ministers gather on Monday, they should recall that many of their own people were refugees not long ago, and that their union was based on values that evolved through their own history of suffering and flight. They must understand that beyond simply sharing a burden they are called on to do what conscience dictates. Adopting the Juncker plan should be the long-overdue start of a far wider European effort to address the crisis, with safer venues and common rules for asylum seekers and refugees, better search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean and an equitable system of relocation. As Europe gets its act together, so should the United States. President Obama indicated Thursday that the United States would take in at least 10,000 Syrian refugees. But the White House also emphasized that the administration would not expedite the review process for refugees, which can take two years to complete. That paltry number sets a terrible example for other nations asked to step up to this urgent challenge.", "articleHeader": "A Plan to Save Refugees and Europe\u2019s Open Borders", "articleBiased": false, "articleSrc": "NYT", "articleUrl": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/opinion/a-plan-to-save-refugees-and-europes-open-borders.html"}, {"articleText": " BERLIN \u2014 Faced with a humanitarian crisis that shows no signs of letting up, Chancellor Angela Merkel gave her fellow Germans and other Europeans a pep talk on Monday, praising those assisting the thousands seeking asylum here but warning that the Continent\u2019s open-border policy was at risk unless all European countries showed an equal willingness to help. The chancellor, whose summer was interrupted by an urgent effort to secure a third financial aid package for Greece, has found herself under fire for what political opponents and even some members of her coalition government have called foot-dragging in dealing with the migration crisis. About 800,000 people are expected to seek asylum in Germany this year, but overcrowded reception centers, a lack of personnel and outbreaks of far-right hatred against some of the new arrivals have left Germany, and some of its European partners, struggling in recent months to cope with the influx. The discovery last week of the bodies of 71 people who were believed to have been bound for the German border in a truck abandoned alongside a highway in Austria has pushed the issue to the fore of the European agenda. At a regular summer news conference in Berlin on Monday, Ms. Merkel encouraged Germans and other Europeans to recall the principles of justice and human rights that were at the heart of the response to the crisis. \u201cIf Europe fails on the question of refugees, if this close link with universal civil rights is broken, then it won\u2019t be the Europe we wished for,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, urging the 27 other countries in the bloc to take more responsibility in offering asylum to refugees. \u201cEurope as a whole must move,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, warning that failing to do so would weaken the agreements that had led to the elimination of border controls and an increase in freedom of movement through much of the Continent over the past 20 years, under what is known as the Schengen agreement. \u201cIf we don\u2019t succeed in fairly distributing refugees then of course the Schengen question will be on the agenda for many,\u201d Ms. Merkel said. With increasing numbers hoping to come to Germany, lured by the stability and job prospects offered by Europe\u2019s largest economy, Ms. Merkel urged Germans to look at the situation in the context of the country\u2019s history. \u201cThe world sees Germany as a country of hope and opportunity, that was not always the case,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, reminding Germans that they could be proud of a postwar country based on the principles of dignity, human rights and the right to political asylum. Ms. Merkel said her government was planning measures in the coming months aimed at coordinating efforts between communities, states and the federal government, which each carry different responsibilities in welcoming, processing and integrating those who are granted the right to remain in the country as refugees. Ms. Merkel praised the thousands of Germans who had opened their homes and pocketbooks to the newcomers and who had donated their time. \u201cThere is no tolerance for those who question the dignity of other people,\u201d she said, echoing comments she made last week at a reception center for asylum seekers in the eastern German city of Heidenau that had been the site of violent protests. Germany needs to be able to process applications more swiftly, and language and elementary-school teachers are needed to help families adapt \u2014 in Berlin alone, 400 new classes of students will be starting the new school year, the chancellor said. Germany must also overcome logistical hurdles like the cumbersome bureaucracy needed to construct shelters at a rapid enough pace, she said, pointing out the country lacks a fire safety ordinance for tents. Ms. Merkel said her government would address issues like those in a law that she hoped would be passed before the end of the year. \u201cGerman thoroughness is super, but right now what we need is German flexibility,\u201d Ms. Merkel said, recalling the government\u2019s swift reaction to the global banking crisis of 2008, the ability to respond to natural disasters and, 25 years ago, the reunification of East and West Germany.", "articleHeader": "Angela Merkel Calls for European Unity to Address Migrant Influx", "articleBiased": false, "articleSrc": "NYT", "articleUrl": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/world/europe/germany-migrants-merkel.html"}, {"articleText": " BUDAPEST \u2014  Rain, misery and more confusion marked the continuing trek of migrants and refugees from Syria and other Middle Eastern nations across Europe on Thursday as thousands endured a drenching downpour, growing opposition in some countries and potential obstacles at various borders. The asylum seekers were coping with conflicting messages from Europe, ranging from warm welcomes in some places to a series of new constraints on their ability to get where they want to go: Hungary mobilized its army on the border with Serbia as a prelude to a possible increased role for the military in its response; Austria halted rail service across the border with Hungary under the strain of the migration influx; and a leading far-right politician in the Netherlands warned of an \u201cIslamic invasion.\u201d The sometimes wrenching changes from day to day have only underscored the lack of unity throughout Europe, particularly after Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, on Wednesday called for the member nations to put aside their differences and commit to a series of unified responses to the Continent\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis in decades. At least 7,000 migrants, including parents with small children, passed the border between Greece and Macedonia on Thursday, confronting heavy rainfall, muddy roads and immense piles of garbage as Macedonia, a poor Balkan country and a candidate to join the European Union, announced that it might follow Hungary\u2019s example and build a fence to keep migrants out. Jasmin Redzepi, president of Legis, an organization that has been helping migrants and refugees passing through the country, said the situation was \u201cvery serious\u201d since only about 700 people could be housed temporarily in tents at the main registration center near the border. Denmark, which had temporarily closed a highway running north from the German border to try to contain migrants seeking to travel to Sweden and other countries, said on Thursday that it would not impede their progress. The about-face highlighted confusion over how to apply European Union rules, which require migrants to register or seek asylum in the country of their arrival. Denmark has recently lowered benefits to migrants, and many of those traveling through the country do not want to remain there. Among the toughest responses to the crisis has been Hungary\u2019s, where the army on Thursday conducted exercises near the Serbian border, which could be preparation for a more active role as thousands continued to pour into the country overnight. The involvement of the army in policing the border, where a 110-mile fence with razor wire was being built to keep migrants out, is subject to the approval of Parliament this month. The number of migrants in the area has shown no sign of abating, and Hungarian military officials have said the army will help secure the country\u2019s borders. More than 3,000 migrants crossed the border into Austria from Hungary overnight, and another 3,000 or so were expected to arrive in the area on Thursday, the police and Red Cross officials at the border said. Rail service was halted between the two countries on Thursday, Reuters reported, because Austria could not handle the number of migrants crossing the border. It was not clear when service would resume. The Hungarian police detained 3,321 people for crossing the border illegally on Wednesday, the highest daily figure so far this year, according to data published by the police. Mr. Juncker on Wednesday issued an impassioned call for countries across the 28-nation bloc to overcome divisions, and he invoked Europe\u2019s historical imperative not to turn its back on the huge number of migrants streaming in. Mr. Juncker proposed that the European Union accept and distribute 160,000 migrants across its member nations, and he implored Europeans not to forget that their ancestors had also fled hardship, poverty and famine. Mr. Juncker\u2019s plea appeared to have been embraced by Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz of Poland, who was quoted by Reuters as saying that she had heard and understood his message. Responding to comments by the opposition that Poland should not heed the European Union\u2019s calls, she said, \u201cCalls for Polish solidarity is no blackmail.\u201d \u201cActing jointly and efficiently in the E.U. is in our interest,\u201d Ms. Kopacz said. \u201cLet\u2019s be decent. President Juncker has reminded us that once, we were also refugees.\u201d Yet in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel has been pushing for mandatory quotas, even some supporters of quotas acknowledged that they were unlikely to be accepted across the bloc. Mr. Juncker\u2019s \u201clatest plan is definitely a move in the right direction,\u201d the left-leaning newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung said in an editorial on Thursday. \u201cHe will surely know, however, that the plan is very unlikely to be implemented. The resistance of individual countries may take it apart \u2014 and with it the entire European project.\u201d Such resistance was evident in Hungary, where Janos Lazar, the prime minister\u2019s chief of staff, reiterated the country\u2019s rejection of a quota system. \u201cThe government won\u2019t accept the diktat, which several European powers are trying to force onto Hungary,\u201d he said. In Netherlands, the far-right politician Geert Wilders was even more emphatic, calling the influx of migrants to Europe an \u201cIslamic invasion\u201d in a parliamentary debate on Thursday, Reuters reported, and underlining that country\u2019s struggle over how to respond to the crisis. \u201cMasses of young men in their 20s with beards singing \u2018Allahu akbar\u2019 across Europe,\u201d he was quoted as saying by the news agency. \u201cIt\u2019s an invasion that threatens our prosperity, our security, our culture and identity.\u201d The Dutch government has indicated a willingness to accept more migrants if the quota system is embraced across the bloc. But, as in many European countries, there has been a fierce debate in the Netherlands about the challenges of immigration, and Mr. Wilders and his Party for Freedom have been citing the crisis to argue that the country risks being overcome by Muslim migrants who do not subscribe to the Netherlands\u2019 vaunted liberal values. Advocates for migrants argued that the commission\u2019s proposals, however well intentioned, were insufficient to address a growing challenge. The plan amounted to small steps, Iverna McGowan, the acting director of the European Institutions Office at Amnesty International, said on Wednesday, adding that more resources were needed to handle the influx in a humane way. Ms. McGowan suggested that the commission was misguided in focusing its resources on returning migrants to so-called safe countries \u2014 like Albania, Serbia and Turkey that it says are free of persecution, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, indiscriminate violence and armed conflict. Such a policy might result in people who would otherwise qualify for asylum being sent back to persecution, she said. Austria and Germany threw open their borders over the weekend, in what was described as a one-time gesture for migrants. So far, however, there has been no attempt to halt the flow of arrivals. Almost all of the migrants who have come from Hungary in recent days have opted to continue on to Germany rather than apply for asylum in Austria. But a backlash is brewing among far-right anti-immigrant groups in Germany, and it remains unclear how far the country\u2019s capacity can be stretched. Germany expects more than 800,000 asylum seekers to arrive this year, and more than half that number are already there, according to Sigmar Gabriel, the country\u2019s vice chancellor. \u201cGermany registered 450,000 refugees, including 105,000 in August and 73,000 in the first eight days of September,\u201d Mr. Gabriel told Parliament in Berlin. \u201cThere may be more than 100,000 in September.\u201d", "articleHeader": "Migrants Meet Rain, Resistance and Confusion at Border Crossings", "articleBiased": false, "articleSrc": "NYT", "articleUrl": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/11/world/europe/migrant-crisis-hungary.html"}]
