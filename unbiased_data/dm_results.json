Some 13,015 refugees arrived in Munich on Saturday alone, and at least 1,400 are expected Sunday to reach the southern German city -- the end of their exhausting and often perilous journey through Hungary and Austria. Germany has become the destination of choice for many refugees, particularly for Syrians after Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to relax asylum rules for citizens of the war-torn country. Migrants arrive at the railway station in Munich, southern Germany, on September 12, 2015 \u00a9Philipp Guelland (AFP/File) However, with some 450,000 people arriving in Europe's biggest economy so far this year, local authorities are buckling under the sudden surge. \"Given the numbers from yesterday, it is very clear that we have reached the upper limit of our capacity,\" said a Munich police spokesman. Federal transport minister Alexander Dobrindt also weighed in, saying \"effective measures are necessary now to stop the influx\". \"That includes help for countries from where refugees are fleeing and also includes an effective control of our own borders which also no longer works given the EU's complete failure to protect its external borders,\" he said in a statement. Dobrindt was essentially referring to the border between Turkey and Greece, where many migrants have crossed. Merkel herself had called Saturday on Athens, while facing its own deep economic crisis, to make more effort to protect the EU's external borders. European Union home affairs ministers will hold emergency talks on Monday as \"the situation of migration phenomena outside and inside the European Union has recently taken unprecedented proportions\", the Luxembourg presidency. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation is also due to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis on Sunday. While Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey are housing millions of refugees, many of the wealthy Gulf states are facing increasing scrutiny over their apparent reluctance to take in migrants.  - 'Brink of collapse?' -  In Munich, order had largely returned to the city's main railway station on Sunday even though the federal interior ministry said 13,015 people arrived over the past day. But Germany's local authorities say they are at the end of their tether. The president of the Upper Bavaria region, Christoph Hillenbrand, said he did not know \"how we can cope\", according to the Bild am Sonntag tabloid which headline its article \"Munich on the brink of collapse\". Bavarian public television BR said the city \"came very close to a humanitarian disaster\", although the authorities finally managed to limit the numbers of people sleeping on mattresses on the floor to just a few dozens, rather than the hundreds as earlier feared. The authorities are mulling over whether to open up the Olympiahalle -- a stadium used for the 1972 Olympics and which today serves as a concert hall or sports arena -- as a temporary shelter for the refugees.  - European divisions -  As the continent scrambles to respond to the biggest movement of people since World War II, sharp divisions have emerged between the European Union's 28 member states -- both among governments and on the ground. While Germany and France are backing proposals to help \"frontline\" states Italy, Greece and Hungary buckling under the strain, European Commission proposals for sharing 160,000 of the new arrivals in a quota scheme are facing resistance from eastern members. Hungary, which reported a new record in migrant arrivals -- 4,330 on Saturday -- was working around the clock to finish a controversial anti-migrant fence along its southern border with Serbia. Budapest has recorded some 180,000 people entering illegally this year and has passed a raft of tough new laws that will take effect on Tuesday, meaning anyone crossing the border illegally can be deported or even jailed. \"These migrants are not coming our way from war zones but from camps in Syria's neighbours... So these people are not fleeing danger and don't need to be scared for their lives,\" hardline Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban told Germany's Bild daily. He said Merkel's decision to relax asylum laws had caused \"chaos\" and accused European leaders of \"living in a dream world\". The idea that quotas would work is an \"illusion,\" he said. \"The influx is endless: from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mali, Ethiopia, Nigeria. If they are all going to come here, then Europe is going to go under.\" Austria's chancellor however slammed its neighbour, comparing Orban's treatment of migrants to Nazi-era cruelty. \"Piling refugees on trains in the hopes that they go far far away brings back memories of the darkest period of our continent,\" Werner Faymann told German weekly Der Spiegel. The division was also seen on the ground, with tens of thousands marching through London on Saturday waving placards saying \"Refugee lives matter\", while in Eastern European capitals, protesters called for refugees to \"go home\". The International Organization for Migration said Friday that more than 430,000 people have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe this year, with 2,748 dying en route or going missing.

German proposals for compulsory quotas within the Europe Union were rebuffed by nations in the east on Friday, with Slovakia's foreign minister saying: \"Migrants don't want to stay\" there. Meanwhile, public pressure on politicians was growing, with tens of thousands of people expected to take part in a Europe-wide \"day of action\" in solidarity with refugees on Saturday. A migrant sits alone as hundreds wait for buses near Nickelsdorf, Austria on the border between Hungary and Austria on September 11, 2015 \u00a9Joe Klamar (AFP) Pressing his Czech, Hungarian, Polish and Slovakian counterparts at a meeting in Prague, Germany's foreign minister warned the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants could be \"the biggest challenge for the EU in its history\". \"If we are united in describing the situation as such, we should be united that such a challenge is not manageable for a single country,\" Frank-Walter Steinmeier said, calling for \"European solidarity\". The International Organization for Migration said over 430,000 migrants and refugees had crossed the Mediterranean to Europe so far in 2015, with 2,748 dying or going missing en route. Germany has taken the lion's share, admitting 450,000 refugees so far this year, most of them fleeing violence in the Middle East -- particularly Syria -- and Asia. But Steinmeier's appeal for EU members to accept proposals to share around 160,000 migrants fell on deaf ears among eastern nations. Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak said he wanted a solution \"that is not imposed\" but \"made jointly\". \"Migrants don't want to stay in Slovakia,\" he added bluntly. Denmark's right-wing government also said it would not take part in the quota scheme.  - 'Not fleeing danger' -  With criticism growing of Hungary's treatment of thousands of people passing through on their way to northern Europe, premier Viktor Orban said he wanted 3.0 billion euros ($3.4 billion) handed to Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, the first ports of call for Syrians trying to escape conflict. \"If it takes more money, we will increase aid until the refugee flows are drying up,\" Orban told Germany's Bild newspaper. \"These migrants do not come from war zones but from camps (in these border countries), where they were safe. \"They are not fleeing danger -- they have already fled and should not fear for their lives.\" They come to Europe not \"because they seek safety but because they want a better life than in a camp. They want a German life, perhaps a Swedish life\". \"But it's a fact: there is no fundamental right to a better life, only a right to security and human dignity,\" he said. Orban's comments come as Hungary builds a fence on the Serbian border to keep migrants out and has adopted tough new laws that will make it a crime to cross the border illegally from next week. \"From September 15, the rules are changing in Hungary, if you cross the border illegally, you will be immediately arrested by the authorities,\" Orban warned Friday. Further concerns about Hungary were raised Friday by video footage showing migrants inside a holding camp being fed -- in the words of one volunteer -- \"like animals in a pen\". Orban insisted Friday that his country was just trying to apply European rules in seeking to register the new arrivals, pinning the blame on fellow EU member Greece for waving migrants through for onward travel north. \"Just because Greece is not keeping to the common (Schengen) agreement does not authorise Hungary to give up on the Schengen rules as well,\" he said in Budapest.  - Selling boats to migrants -  EU lawmakers have called for an international conference on migration, together with the United States, United Nations and Arab countries. Facing criticism that his government has been too slow to help, US President Barack Obama pledged to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees over a year starting October 1. Underscoring the scale of the crisis, some 7,600 migrants entered Macedonia in just 12 hours overnight, according to a UN official, with more buses on their way from Greece. From Macedonia, the migrant route cuts through Serbia into Hungary and from there veers west into Austria, from where most of the arrivals continue on to Germany and Sweden. Germany has placed 4,000 troops on standby for this weekend alone to cope with the influx. From the smugglers who pack migrants into leaky boats, to taxi drivers who charge exorbitant sums to ferry them across land, some people have sought to profit from the migrants' plight. The French government on Friday suspended an honorary consul in the Turkish resort of Bodrum after she was secretly filmed selling rubber dinghies and life jackets to desperate refugees.

The United Nations called for the swift creation of\nlarge-scale reception centres in frontline states such as\nHungary and Greece, and one U.N. agency warned that millions\nmore refugees could arrive in Europe if Syria's civil war\ncontinues to rage. Many of the tens of thousands of refugees now trekking from\nGreece via the Balkans and Hungary towards western Europe are\nfleeing the Syrian war in search of sanctuary, above all in more\nwelcoming and generous countries such as Germany and Sweden. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said his\ncountry, which expects to take in 800,000 asylum seekers this\nyear alone, had finite resources and urged other European\ncountries to do much more to share the burden. He said Germany expected to receive another 40,000 migrants\nthis weekend. And as politicians from the left and right accused\nChancellor Angela Merkel's government of losing control of the\nrefugee situation, the defence ministry put 4,000 troops on\nstandby to help with the influx. Citing security concerns, Austria partially shut a highway\nlinking Vienna and Hungary on Friday. Some 8,000 people had\ncrossed the border on Thursday and a further 4,500 arrived\novernight, Austrian police said. The rail link to Hungary also\nremains shut due to \"massive overburdening\" by the migrants. Hungary is racing to construct a fence along its border with\nSerbia by early October to help stem the tide. It also plans to\nimplement much tougher immigration rules from next week. Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a fiery populist who has framed\nthe crisis as a battle to preserve Europe's prosperity and\n\"Christian identity\", angrily criticised the behaviour of the\nmostly Muslim migrants who have been filling up central Budapest\nand disrupting traffic along roads running westward to Austria. \"They seized railway stations, rejected giving fingerprints,\nfailed to cooperate and are unwilling to go to places where they\nwould get food, water, accommodation and medical care ... They\nrebelled against Hungarian legal order,\" Orban told reporters. \"From the 15th, Hungarian authorities will not forgive\nillegal border crossings,\" he said. More than 170,000 migrants have crossed into Hungary from\nnon-EU Serbia so far this year. Many try to avoid being\nregistered in Hungary for fear of being stranded there or\nreturned to the country later in their journey across Europe.  MILLIONS MORE COULD COME In Geneva, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\nsaid it was sending pre-fabricated housing units to provide\ntemporary overnight shelter for 300 families in Hungary but also\nexpressed concern over Budapest's tough approach, including the\npossible deployment of troops to tackle the crisis. \"Obviously we expect authorities to respect rights of\nrefugees whether they are the police or army,\" said UNHCR\nspokesman William Spindler. Syria's four-year civil war has so far displaced almost\neight million people, said Peter Salama of UNICEF, the U.N.\nchildrens' agency, adding: \"There could be millions and millions\nmore refugees leaving Syria and ultimately (going) to the\nEuropean Union and beyond.\" So far this year, a record 433,000 refugees and migrants\nhave crossed the Mediterranean to Europe, more than double the\ntotal for all of 2014, the International Organization for\nMigration (IOM) said on Friday. The European Commission, backed by Germany and France, wants\nEU member states to accept mandatory quotas to share out some\n160,000 refugees but the plan faces stiff resistance in some\ncapitals. On Friday the UNHCR said the number of people\nrequiring relocation had now risen to 200,000. Speaking in Prague, Steinmeier said the EU needed a \"fair\nmechanism of redistribution of migrants (still coming)\". \"This challenge cannot be borne by one country. We have to\ninvoke European solidarity,\" he told a joint news conference\nwith the foreign ministers of the Czech Republic, Slovakia,\nHungary and Poland - countries opposed to the EU's proposal for\nmandatory quotas. Germany has come under fire from Orban and other east\nEuropean leaders for opening its door to Syrian asylum seekers,\nsaying such generosity will only encourage many more to come. Denmark, which like Britain has opted out of EU rules on\njustice and home affairs, said on Friday it would not take part\nin the Commission's relocation scheme. Earlier this week, Denmark shut off some traffic with\nGermany to curb refugees trying to reach Sweden, which remains\nmuch more welcoming than other Scandinavian countries, but later\nallowed them to travel through. Finland said it would accept its two percent share of asylum\nseekers under the Commission plan but said it remained opposed\nto mandatory quotas and would cut benefits for refugees. EU interior ministers are due to discuss the Commission\nproposals on Monday. If they fail to reach a deal on tackling\nthe crisis, European Council chief Donald Tusk said on Friday he\nwould call an extraordinary summit of EU leaders this month.\n\n (Additional reporting by Reuters bureaux in Berlin, Prague,\nVienna, Helsinki, Copenhagen; Writing by Gareth Jones; Editing\nby Giles Elgood)", "articleBiased": false, "articleSrc": "DM"}, {"articleHeader": "Record number of migrants cross Mediterranean, agency says", "articleUrl": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3230584/UN-welcomes-Europes-refugee-plan-says-EU-respect-right-asylum.html", "articleText": " By\n\nReuters\n \nPublished:\n  14:06 GMT, 11 September 2015\n\n | \nUpdated:\n  14:06 GMT, 11 September 2015\n\n By Stephanie Nebehay GENEVA, Sept 11 (Reuters) - More than 430,000 refugees and\nmigrants have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe so far in\n2015, a record number that is more than double the total for the\nwhole of last year, the International Organization for Migration\nsaid on Friday. The United Nations refugee agency called for decent mass\nreception centres to be set up immediately in Greece, Italy and\nHungary, on the front lines of a huge influx of refugees being\nreceived in \"appalling conditions\". The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) welcomed a\nEuropean Union proposal to share out 160,000 refugees and an\noffer by Washington to take 10,000 Syrians over the next year,\nbut said \"the United States could and should do much more\". The Geneva-based International Organization for Migration\nsaid a record 432,761 refugees and migrants were now estimated\nto have made the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to\nEurope so far this year, while 2,748 have drowned. The IOM said an estimated 309,356 people had arrived by sea\nin Greece as of Sept. 10, with another 121,139 arriving in\nItaly, 2,166 in Spain and 100 in Malta. This was a record and compared with 197,940 people who\narrived by sea in those four European countries in all of 2014,\nIOM spokesman Daniel Szabo told Reuters. The UNHCR is sending prefabricated housing units to provide\ntemporary overnight shelter for 300 families in Hungary, a\ncountry that is building a 175-km (110-mile) fence along its\nsouthern border with Serbia to stem the flow of people trekking\nnorth, many aiming for Germany. \"We are stepping up operations in Europe, including\nHungary,\" UNHCR spokesman William Spindler told a news briefing. Fifty pre-fab family homes have also arrived in the Greek\nisland of Lesbos, and a further 300 are being sent to nearby\nKos, while 50 have arrived in Macedonia, he said.  APPALLING CONDITIONS \"We are very concerned, we were the first to call attention\nto the appalling conditions in many of these places. They are\nslowing getting better, they are still far from meeting\ninternational standards,\" Spindler said. The UNHCR was \"closely following\" Hungary's use of the army\nto control the situation. \"Obviously we expect authorities to\nrespect rights of refugees whether they are the police or army\nor the civilian authorities,\" he said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban warned that his police\nwould take tougher action from next week against migrants who he\nsaid had rebelled against authorities, seized railway stations\nand refused to be registered. UNHCR urged the EU to uphold national and international law\nin managing its borders, including by ensuring people are able\nto seek asylum from war and persecution. The UNHCR reiterated that the EU would need to relocate\n200,000 people from the frontline European countries such as\nGreece and Italy by the end of 2016, more than the 160,000\nmentioned in the EU plan. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on\nWednesday the EU would offer better protection for refugees but\nwould also improve its frontier defences and deport more illegal\nmigrants. About half of those crossing the Mediterranean are Syrians\nfleeing civil war, a figure \"expected to continue rising rapidly\nover the coming weeks and months\", the UNHCR said. Afghans, Eritreans, Nigerians and Somalis compose the other\nfour largest groups of nationalities in the human tide seeking\nEuropean shores, Spindler said. \"They will not be deterred by barbed wire or even taking\ndangerous sea voyages. The answer is to provide adequate legal\navenues for people to come to Europe in safety,\" Spindler said.

Austria closed the A4 motorway near Hungary for security\nreasons on Friday morning. A spokeswoman for the road operator\nASFINAG later said the eastbound lanes towards Hungary had\nreopened. Those walking had been picked up by buses and taxis. Around 8,000 people crossed the border into Austria on\nThursday and a further 4,500 had crossed since midnight, a\npolice spokesman said, adding that he expected the number of\ncrossings to match Thursday's. Austria cut its rail link to Hungary on Thursday, citing a\n\"massive overburdening\" of its capacity by migrants who continue\nto stream in from Hungary, many of them having fled the civil\nwar in Syria and marched through the Western Balkans. The train\nline will remain closed over the weekend, the rail company said. Since Germany and Austria said on Saturday that they would\nlet the wave of migrants enter their territory, tens of\nthousands of people have passed through Austria on their way to\nGermany. Only hundreds have requested asylum in Austria. \"Around 1,500 people have spent the night outdoors,\" the\npolice spokesman said. The authorities were trying to move\npeople \"to where they can continue their journey\", he added. The police handling the new arrivals at the Hungarian border\nare struggling to provide food and shelter for the migrants\nwhile arranging transport - largely on buses, though two special\ntrains were provided to shuttle people to Vienna. Hungary has transported tens of thousands of people to near\nthe Austrian border in the past week. They have then crossed the\nborder on foot. Others have entered Austria by train, but that\noption has been unavailable since Thursday's rail suspension. The Wiener Zeitung, a daily newspaper, said the crisis would\ncost Austria an extra 1 billion euros ($1.13 billion), citing an\nestimate by the Foreign Ministry, which deals with integration\nmatters. Kurier, another daily, said the figure was for 2016. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said it had not\ncompiled any such estimate.

With 3,321 registered entering from Serbia on Wednesday, the\nhighest daily total yet, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of\nstaff said Hungary planned to introduce \"different rules of the\ngame\" from next week, with penalties for illegal entry,\naccelerated asylum procedures and possible expulsion back over\nthe border. He said the fence, in part being built by prisoners along\nthe 175-km (109-mile) border, would be completed sooner than\nplanned, by the beginning rather than the end of October. \"This 3.5-4-metre tall fence can be adequate to protect the\ncountry, especially if policemen are patrolling on the other\nside,\" Lazar told a weekly news conference. He said the government would meet next Tuesday to consider a\nproposal by the interior ministry to declare a \"state of crisis\ndue to mass migration\". Such a move would make it easier for\nauthorities to take control of public or municipal property, \nfor example to accommodate asylum seekers. A week later, parliament is expected to discuss sending the\narmy to the border. RAZOR WIRE Over 176,000 migrants and refugees, many of them fleeing the\nSyrian war, have been recorded entering Hungary over the\nEuropean Union's external border this year en route to the\nricher and more generous countries of western and northern\nEurope. Many more may have entered undetected, slipping through\nthe hands of over-stretched border police. Shrugging off the Cold War echoes of razor wire and\nwatchtowers along an east European border, Orban says the flow\nof migrants must stop, framing it as a battle for the prosperity\nand \"Christian identity\" of Europe. Hungary has declared Serbia, an impoverished former Yugoslav\nrepublic still years away from joining the European Union, to be\na safe country for refugees to seek asylum. That gives Budapest\nthe right to turn down any and all asylum requests from people\nentering across that border. The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said this week the\ndesignation of Serbia as a so-called 'safe third country' was a\n\"disputed matter\" between Hungary and the agency. Lazar said that under the new rules, authorities would\nassess an asylum claim within 12 days in a fast-track procedure. He added that those arriving would receive support under the\nGeneva Convention and other international treaties, such as food\nand shelter, until their applications were processed. Lazar said Hungary planned to expand the capacity of\nreception centres in the next two weeks. The government plans to\nset up \"transit zones\" in the narrow border strip, which the\ngovernment has earlier compared to airport transit lounges in\nthat migrants held there would not be considered to have\nactually entered Hungarian territory. Rights groups say this\nwill strand people in a legal limbo. \n\n (Additional reporting by Sandor Peto; Writing by Matt Robinson;\nEditing by Mark Trevelyan)", "articleBiased": false, "articleSrc": "DM"}, {"articleHeader": "Europe's refugee wave hits Denmark, heads for Sweden", "articleUrl": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3228998/Motorway-connecting-Denmark-Germany-reopened.html", "articleText": " By\n\nReuters\n \nPublished:\n  14:15 GMT, 10 September 2015\n\n | \nUpdated:\n  14:15 GMT, 10 September 2015\n\n By Alexander Tange RODBY, Denmark, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Denmark on Thursday\nallowed refugees to move freely through its territory to Sweden\nafter days of chaos when authorities closed ferry services and a\nmotorway link with Germany in an attempt to stem an inflow of\nthousands of asylum seekers. Denmark, whose government took out adverts in Lebanese\nnewspapers to discourage migrants, emerged as the latest front\nin Europe's worst refugee crisis in decades as 3,200 people\nentered since Sunday, most trying to get to Sweden. Sweden expects to receive 80,000 refugees this year and has\nmore asylum seekers per capita than any other European nation\nthanks to a generous immigration policy allowing automatic\npermanent residency for Syrians. Allowing the resumption of traffic on ferries and the\nmotorway, Danish police said they had no power to detain\nrefugees. That means that thousands will now travel on to Sweden\nto seek asylum. \"There are no other possibilities than to let them go free,\nand consequently we cannot keep them from travelling where they\nwill,\" National Police Commissioner Jens Henrik Hojbjerg said. Centre right Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen held talks\nwith political leaders on Thursday in a second emergency meeting\nthis week but did not announce concrete action. \"Germany, Denmark and Sweden are in an extraordinary\nsituation and in that situation it is our task to live up to our\ninternational obligations,\" Rasmussen said afterwards. \"I don't think anyone, at least not me or the party leaders,\nas I have heard it, wants Danish police to use force in a very\nviolent way,\" he said. In Stockholm, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said EU\nrules under which refugees should be registered in the country\nwhere they first arrive must be upheld and the decision to send\nrefugees on to Sweden was \"unfortunate\".  ACROSS THE BRIDGE When not temporarily detained, the refugees marched or took\ntrains to Copenhagen, which is a 35-minute ride from Malmo in\nSweden across the Oresund Bridge. Sweden's Migration Agency said 686 people had applied for\nasylum in Malmo since Sunday and more that 13,700 had arrived in\nthe country in the past five weeks. Both countries have a generous welfare system but Denmark\nhas recently tightened immigration and citizenship rules,\nincluding cutting benefits for refugees by up to half in a bid\nto discourage them from staying here. Sweden stands out in the Nordics as the exception. Denmark's\ntough refugee policy mirrors similar trends in Finland and\nNorway where right-wing anti-immigrant parties are on the\nascendant and part of coalition governments. Finland's centre-right government proposed increasing some\ntaxes to help cover the costs of migrants coming into the\ncountry. The Danish People's Party (DF), once on the political\nfringe, became the second largest parliamentary force after\nJune's election, gaining popularity largely due to its\nanti-immigration and eurosceptic rhetoric. Rasmussen's minority government depends on the party's\nsupport in parliament although his response to the crisis this\nweek has not been anywhere near as strong as the DF would like. \"We are a country based on law and order,\" DF leader\nKristian Thulesen Dahl told reporters. \"Citizens of other\ncountries must also be able to see that when they decide whether\nto use Denmark as a transit country in this asylum shopping\nwhich is going on ... We need control.\"  REFUGEES GIVEN LIFTS Refugees have been streaming in by two routes from Germany\n-- crossing by train overland into Jutland, the western part of\nDenmark that is connected to continental Europe, or by ferries\ncarrying trains that arrive in Lolland, an island linked by\nbridges to Zealand, where Copenhagen is located. At Rodbyhaven, the landing point for the ferries, around 50\npeople gathered, most volunteers with water bottles, as three\nboats arrived during the day, a Reuters reporter saw. No passport checks were made at Rodby on Thursday when\npassengers disembarked from ferries. Akhmed, a 32-year-old from Copenhagen, said that like others\nhe had come to give refugees a lift to Copenhagen. \"I could sit at home and count on other people doing it, but\nmy conscience couldn't stand for it,\" Akhmed said. One group of volunteers said they had been giving lifts to\nrefugees for 48 hours now, leaving them at Copenhagen's central\nstation rather than in Malmo, to avoid charges of human\ntrafficking. On Wednesday, authorities closed down the Jutland motorway\nafter 300 refugees began walking along it, and suspended train\nferries to Lolland. On Thursday the motorway reopened and most\ntrain ferry services resumed. The refugees are part of a wave of migrants sweeping north\nthrough Europe, many escaping the war in Syria. In Hungary, police said they detained a record 3,321\nmigrants on Wednesday and the interior ministry indicated it may\ndeclare a state of crisis next week. Austria suspended train services with Hungary at least for\nthe rest of Thursday because it cannot handle the volume of\nmigrants.\n\n (Additional reporting by Teis Jensen and Annabella Nielsen in\nCopenhagen, Daniel Dickson in Stockholm, Tom Heneghan in Berlin;\nWriting by Sabina Zawadzki; Editing by Alistair Scrutton and\nGiles Elgood)", "articleBiased": false, "articleSrc": "DM"}, {"articleHeader": "EU response plans on migration crisis", "articleUrl": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/reuters/article-3227847/EU-response-plans-migration-crisis.html", "articleText": " By\n\nReuters\n \nPublished:\n  13:42 GMT, 9 September 2015\n\n | \nUpdated:\n  13:42 GMT, 9 September 2015\n\n By Alastair Macdonald STRASBOURG, Sept 9 (Reuters) - European Commission President\nJean-Claude Juncker detailed a plan to tackle the EU migrant\ncrisis in an annual State of the Union address to the European\nParliament in Strasbourg on Wednesday. Here are elements of existing EU plans, before an emergency\nmeeting of interior ministers on Monday:  BORDER FORCES Following the drowning of some 800 people on a single boat\noff Libya in April, the EU effectively reversed a sharp cutback\nin warships conducting search and rescue operations; since June,\na naval operation has been targeting people-smugglers. Plans to\nroam far into Libyan waters are on hold, seeking U.N. support. Some EU leaders have suggested a new European border force.\nGermany, France and Italy proposed an EU management system for\nthe external borders.  EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE The EU has paid for food, medicine, shelter and other needs\nfor migrants in countries which have asked for it. Italy and\nGreece will get nearly half of 2.4 billion euros ($2.7\nbillion)to help with the crisis over several years.  RELOCATION Juncker renewed and enlarged a proposal rejected by states\nin June for them to take in quotas of asylum seekers fixed by\nBrussels. He proposed relocating 160,000 people over two years,\nup from 40,000, and from Hungary (54,000) as well as from Greece\n(66,400) and Italy (39,400). For now, only Syrians, Eritreans\nand Iraqis qualify for relocation. Those who process people's claims to refugee status would\nreceive 6,000 euros per person, with Italy, Greece and Hungary\nreceiving 500 euros per person relocated. The total cost is put\nat 780 million euros. The Commission says once asylum seekers are relocated they\nhave no right to move within Europe's Schengen borderless zone. Juncker also proposed a permanent mechanism of relocation\nfor future crises, modifying the Dublin Regulation system by\nwhich claims are handled by the first EU state reached. Many governments, especially in the east, have opposed such\na scheme, calling it diktat from Brussels and saying it may\nattract migrants and disrupt societies unused to immigration. An\nattempt to secure voluntary pledges for 40,000 fell short and\nGermany and France, powerful players in the bloc, have thrown\ntheir combined weight behind a mandatory distribution. RESETTLEMENT Having rejected mandatory national quotas to take in 20,000\nrefugees direct from U.N. sites outside Europe, states pledged\nto take 22,000 in total in a two-year pilot scheme. It starts \nsoon and may expand, in cooperation with U.N. agencies who help\nsome 4 million Syrians as well as millions of other refugees. Britain, the bloc's second-biggest economy, is exempt from\nEU asylum policies but will has said it will take in 20,000\nSyrians direct from the Middle East over the next five years.  HOTSPOTS Accompanying the relocation of asylum-seekers from Italy and\nGreece, EU agencies will staff \"hotspots\" in Catania and Piraeus\nto identify and fingerprint migrants. Northern countries\ncomplain that failure to do so has broken EU rules and let many\ntravel over open EU borders to claim asylum in northern Europe. Hungary, which is setting up its own \"transit zones\" on the\nborder with non-EU Serbia which it has lined with fencing, has\nsaid it does not want hotspots - a key part of EU proposals to\ntoughen up and accelerate a process of distinguishing refugees\nfrom economic migrants and speed the removal of the latter.  DEPORTATION Economic migrants whose claims for refugee status fail will\nbe returned home more quickly. The EU is working with countries\nto ensure they take more people back. Juncker announced a shared\nEU list of seven \"safe\" states, notably the west Balkan states\nof Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia and Kosovo, as\nwell as Turkey. Their citizens are likely to face a \"fast-track\"\ndeportation if they claim asylum in the EU.  AID The EU will use its development aid budget to reduce poverty\nand other factors that drive migration, to encourage governments\nto curb people-smuggling gangs and dissuade their citizens from\nmigrating, and to cooperate with EU deportation procedures. The Commission has proposed creating a 1.8 billion euro\ntrust fund for Africa. There will be a summit with the African\nUnion in Malta on Nov. 11-12 and with western Balkan countries\nin the next few weeks.  FOREIGN MISSIONS Officials have steered away from suggestions the EU should\nset up facilities to process asylum applications in Africa or\nthe Middle East. Among other things, some say they could be\nvulnerable to attack and hard to manage. However, EU embassies\nare to have immigration officers to monitor migration trends. The EU is working with international agencies in Niger to\ninform migrants about to head for Libya of the risks they will\nrun and their low chances of being allowed to settle in Europe.  LEGAL MIGRATION The EU executive is reviewing schemes to issue EU visas to\nskilled workers as among the safe routes for immigration. It\nplans to bring new proposals in early 2016.\n($1 = 0.8977 euros)\n\n (Additional reporting by Francesco Guarascio and Philip\nBlenkinsop; Reporting by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Alison\nWilliams)", "articleBiased": false, "articleSrc": "DM"}]
