As the Russian Foreign Ministry appears to be moving toward recognizing the results of the voting, which was dismissed by the United States as a “sham,” Western officials are increasingly concerned that the Kremlin may be taking the steps necessary to establish an enclave that remains outside Kiev’s control. During a visit to the Pentagon, the commander, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, echoed those worries, telling reporters that “I am concerned that the conditions are there that could create a frozen conflict.” Moscow followed that blueprint after the war with Georgia in 2008, establishing enclaves in Abkhazia and South Ossetia to ensure that the territorially compromised nation could not join NATO. It did the same earlier with Transnistria, a breakaway territory of Moldova where Russians have been stationed. The concern now is that a buffer zone between Ukrainian and separatist forces, established as part of a September cease-fire, may become a de facto border of the new enclave. Meanwhile, the border between eastern Ukraine and Russia has remained open. “We have seen a general trend towards a hardening of this line of demarcation and much more softening of the actual Ukraine-Russia border,” General Breedlove said. “The Ukraine-Russia border is wide open,” he added. “It is completely porous. Russian equipment, resupply, training flows back and forth freely.” Though the Kremlin has denied that it has sent forces into Ukraine, General Breedlove said about 250 to 300 Russian soldiers are still in the country. “These are not fighting formations,” he said. “These are formations and specialists who are in there doing training and equipping of the separatist forces.” And as the Sunday vote approached, he reported, some Russian military units edged closer to Russia’s border with Ukraine, an intimidating move that appeared intended to caution the Ukrainian government not to intervene. “Some of those formations have moved closer to the border,” General Breedlove said. “We believe that was probably to bring some pressure on and make sure that the elections went according to the separatists’ plans.” On Saturday, in another show of force, a column of about 60 unmarked military trucks drove through Donetsk. In total, Russia has seven battalions near Ukraine, down from the 18 battalions — about 20,000 troops — it had there in August. But the forces are enough to maintain Russia’s influence in the area and to buttress Moscow’s efforts to help the separatists. On Monday, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe reported that pro-Russian fighters had fired on one of its surveillance drones the day before as it was filming pro-Russian forces on the move near a Ukrainian checkpoint. “New drones under fire east of the contact line,” the group said in a post on Twitter. The organization issued a statement saying the drone was flying at an altitude of about 5,000 feet near Mariupol, in the south of the Donetsk region, on the pro-Russian side of the front. It was filming a civilian truck when “a canvas covering on the back of the truck was removed, revealing a truck-mounted antiaircraft gun, which immediately fired numerous rounds” at the drone but missed. Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, has said he does not want a crystallization of the status quo into a frozen conflict, but the Russian Foreign Ministry nevertheless issued a statement saying it would respect the outcome of separatist elections. Russia “respects the choice made by residents of the southeast” of Ukraine, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Grigory Karasin, later told the Interfax news agency. “Our position is that the elected representatives of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions thereby received a mandate to hold negotiations with the central Ukrainian authorities and, acting as part of their political dialogue, tackle all the problems that have accumulated over many months,” Mr. Karasin said. The ministry statement stopped short of recognizing the outcome of the vote, but still drew a din of criticism from European officials. Steffen Seibert, the spokesman for Germany’s chancellor, Angela Merkel, told reporters in Berlin that it was “incomprehensible that there are official Russian voices that are respecting or even recognizing these so-called elections.” The turn of events in the rebellious territories ruled out any early lifting of European sanctions imposed on Russia and could lead to further sanctions if security deteriorated, Mr. Seibert said. The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, said in a statement, “I consider today’s ‘presidential and parliamentary elections’ in Donetsk and Luhansk ‘People’s Republics’ a new obstacle on the path toward peace.” The Ukrainian government has refused to negotiate directly with the rebel leadership outside of the O.S.C.E.-brokered cease-fire talks that include European and Russian officials, and it calls the separatist leadership “terrorists.” President Petro O. Poroshenko described Sunday’s elections as a farce. The rebel central election committee in Donetsk said Aleksandr Zakharchenko, a former electrician, had won the election with about 78 percent of the vote. Mr. Zakharchenko commanded a pro-Russian militia, Oplot, until August, when the Donetsk Supreme Soviet elevated him to prime minister, replacing a Russian citizen in a leadership shuffle intended to put a local face on the movement. Mr. Zakharchenko is a Russian-speaking ethnic Ukrainian. In Luhansk, election officials said Igor Plotnitsky, a former public health inspector, had won with about 63 percent of the vote. The elections in both regions offered few plausible alternatives, and separatist officials said the purpose of the voting was to legitimize the leadership and compel Kiev to negotiate with them.","articleSrc":"NYT","articleHeader":"Russia Continues to Train and Equip Ukraine Rebels, NATO Official Says "}

About 700 soldiers crossed Russia’s western border into the snowy war zone in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council said in a statement that was not possible to verify independently. They came armed with a wide array of heavy weapons, Prime Minister Arseniy P. Yatsenyuk told journalists in Kiev, the capital. The country’s intelligence agencies “confirm that men and equipment entered from Russia,” he said. Howitzers and other artillery and antiaircraft systems were said to have crossed the border. “These items cannot be bought in a market in Donetsk or the Russian Federation,” Mr. Yatsenyuk said. “They can only come from the stock of the Russian Defense Ministry.” The accusation followed a weekend of escalating and bloody mayhem alarming even by the standards of eastern Ukraine. After first being partly pushed from the ruins of the main terminal of the Donetsk airport last week, the Ukrainian military counterattacked with tanks over the weekend and claimed to have recaptured all the lost ground. At least four Ukrainian soldiers were killed and scores wounded in the fighting, and human rights groups in Donetsk were investigating reports that up to 10 civilians had been killed by stray shells. Beyond the immediate conflict zone, an explosion outside a courthouse in Kharkiv, another eastern city, wounded 12 people in the latest in a string of politically hued bombings and assassinations in eastern Ukraine that the authorities have labeled terrorist acts. Bombs have detonated in centers where volunteers collect goods for the army, in bars frequented by activists who support Ukraine’s government and outside hospitals treating wounded soldiers. On Sunday, an unexplained explosion destroyed nine parked cars in a district of Kiev. Russia’s Foreign Ministry accused Ukraine on Monday of making a disingenuous offer to reinstate the cease-fire negotiated on Sept. 5. The ministry said the authorities in Kiev had first ignored peace overtures in a letter from President Vladimir V. Putin that was sent late last week. Ukraine’s president, Petro O. Poroshenko, proposed an immediate recommitment to a cease-fire in the east. “Ukraine is ready to sign a cease-fire agreement if the sides stick to the Minsk accords,” he said, referring to the talks in Belarus that led to the cease-fire. “Ukraine wants peace.” Both sides in the conflict concede that what they are now fighting over is chiefly a symbol, and a battered, ugly one at that: the ruins of the airport. For the Ukrainians, the airport forms the army’s toehold in the rebel capital city, Donetsk, illustrating to residents there that a breakaway region will never really be viable or independent. For Russia, the continual rebel efforts to seize the ruins achieve substantially the same goal: highlighting the perpetual state of insecurity Ukraine will live in, so long as Russia’s interests are not reckoned with. Russia’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement over the weekend saying Ukraine should voluntarily hand over the airport to separatist control. European foreign ministers meeting Monday opted to keep economic sanctions against Russia in place, despite suggestions in an internal European Union policy document leaked last week that European nations should seek to revive some cooperation with Russia. Fighters with the Donetsk People’s Republic, one of the separatist forces, seized control of the airport’s runway and taxiways last week, according to Ukrainian accounts, while the terminal buildings were the setting of bitter, close combat. Pro-Russian groups controlled the second floor and above in the main terminal building, while the Ukrainian forces held lower floors and access tunnels. Stairwells and even holes in the floors became front lines. In the tank assault on Sunday, Ukraine’s army claimed to have expelled the separatists from the runway, allowing the army to move new forces into the terminal and evacuate casualties. That success soon led to a reversal. Ukrainian and separatist authorities both reported Monday that the separatists had collapsed the second floor in an explosion, wounding or killing an unknown number of Ukrainians below. Yuri Biryukov, an adviser to Mr. Poroshenko, wrote on Facebook that “the debris fell on the fighters” and that “there are many wounded.” Despite the Ukrainian claims, there was no indication on Monday that newly arrived Russian forces were involved in the battle for the airport.","articleSrc":"NYT","articleHeader":"Ukraine Accuses Russia of Sending More Troops and Artillery to Aid Rebels "}

He continues to insist that Russian soldiers and weapons are not involved in the conflict in the eastern sector of the country, despite evidence to the contrary from NATO, the United States and independent journalists. Last week Mr. Putin added a new and especially cruel twist to his formula of deception by decreeing that the deaths or wounds of Russian soldiers in “special operations” can be classified as military secrets, even in peacetime. In the past, the list of state secrets applied only to personnel losses in wartime. The decree furthers a climate of propaganda and secrecy that was well established during Soviet times and that Mr. Putin has worked hard to revive. It could lead to the arrest of journalists and human rights activists who gather and publicize information about soldiers’ deaths, further restricting the open flow of essential information. On a personal level, the decree is especially heartless because it could make it even more difficult for loved ones to obtain the facts about their soldiers’ deaths or injuries, which grieving families need to understand the circumstances of the casualties. Government critics also charge that Russia’s refusal to acknowledge that its soldiers are in combat denies them disability payments and their relatives death benefits and other awards. Mr. Putin clearly fears a political backlash from Russians who could turn against him and his destructive policies if they learn the truth about Ukraine. Public opinion polls have largely shown that Russian support for Mr. Putin is high and many Russians don’t believe their military forces are involved in Ukraine. But that could change. A recent report by members of Russia’s political opposition said that at least 220 active-duty Russian soldiers had died in Ukraine since last spring. And there are signs that the toll is rising, including wounded troops showing up at hospitals, new graves appearing in cemeteries, dozens of military funerals during the past year and testimony from relatives of the dead, The Times reported. Some analysts suspect the new decree may also be a sign that Mr. Putin is gearing up for another military push in Ukraine, when the casualty numbers could be even higher. Regardless of the executive order, Russians have access to the Internet and even in villages, information gets through. Mr. Putin may not be able to count on the complicity of his citizens if more young men come home in body bags.","articleSrc":"NYT","articleHeader":"Vladimir Putin Hides the Truth"}

At a McDonald’s in a provincial town northwest of here, health inspectors in lab coats swooped in for a surprise check, clipboards, test tubes and cotton swabs in hand. After finishing, they promptly filed a lawsuit to stop the fast food chain from selling certain items across all of Russia. The offense: The calorie counts on the cheeseburgers, Filet-O-Fish, berry ice cream and other items did not match the amount listed on the paper tray liners. As geopolitical tensions continue to simmer over the Ukraine crisis, Russia isn’t just a perilous place to do business. It is entirely unpredictable. Some companies like Exxon Mobil and the energy services firm Schlumberger have been ensnared by the Western sanctions intended to cut into core Russian industries. Others such as Visa and Condé Nast have been hit by the tit-for-tat response by the Kremlin. Iconic American brands are proving useful for political target practice. The inspection of the McDonald’s restaurant over the summer came just days after the European Union and United States announced a set of sanctions against Russia for supporting pro-Russian separatists striving to carve out independent states in eastern Ukraine. Around the same time, health officials in a remote mountain region threatened to pull Jack Daniels products from the shelves, saying they had found that its honey-flavored whiskey included a chemical substance associated with insect repellent; Brown-Forman, its maker, denied the accusations. “It’s like sailing into the wind,” Alexis Rodzianko, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, said of American companies trying to do business here these days. “The options are limited, and progress is slower.” Multinationals have invested billions of dollars in Russia in recent years, betting on its strong growth outlook. But politics have now curdled its prospects and the country faces a recession. Volkswagen, Ford, Adidas and Carlsberg, among others, have already blamed Russia for taking a bite out of global earnings. In late October, McDonald’s, which has been subject to 200 spot inspections in recent months, reported its steepest quarterly decline since 2002. It is a bit like corporate quicksand. Move too quickly to respond to Western requests, and companies risk blowback by Russia. When the United States and Europe started the first rounds of sanctions, Visa and MasterCard cut services to several Russian banks banned from transactions with American companies, some temporarily. The Kremlin retaliated by passing a law forcing Visa and MasterCard to either deposit vast sums with the central bank or relocate their payment processing systems to Russia. Visa and MasterCard threatened to withdraw from Russia rather than pay the deposit and said shifting operations to Russia would take longer than allowed under the law. The companies won a reprieve on Oct. 23, when the deadline was delayed until next year. Many companies are redeploying staff out of the region or have been forced to put them on paid leave. Big Wall Street banks have tried to repurpose some Russian experts as analysts to cover the broader emerging markets. Morgan Stanley has moved two metals and mining analyst positions from Moscow to London. J. P. Morgan moved three trading jobs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch one fixed-income analyst and Deutsche Bank a sales representative, all also to London. “You don’t want to be a dedicated Russia guy anymore,” said one American banker who recently lost his job in Moscow but did not want to be identified. “I’m trying to learn Turkey.” Some companies are deftly maneuvering to comply with Western sanctions while not upsetting their Russian partners. Schlumberger has withdrawn its American and European employees from Russia. The rest of its work force remains to deal with Russian oil companies. Schlumberger declined to comment on its personnel policies. Exxon dodged a potential problem with its Russian partner, the state oil company Rosneft, by winning a waiver from the American government. The United States allowed Exxon to keep drilling an offshore exploration well in the Arctic Ocean, legally, past the sanction deadline. Exxon has since withdrawn its exploration teams, but not before finishing the Universitetskaya-1 well. The discovery kept Russia’s Arctic ambitions alive. In some cases, the situation has made doing business all but impossible. Russia passed a law in September limiting foreign ownership of media properties. As a result, Condé Nast and Hearst need to sell controlling stakes in their Russian glossies by 2016. Walt Disney will have to offload its share of the Disney Channel in Russia. The problems could get worse. Russia’s Parliament is considering a law that would allow the government to seize foreign-owned assets — a rule worrying enough that it precipitated a global stock dip in September. The legislation has passed the first of three required votes. If the law goes into effect, even American companies that have been unaffected could be in a difficult position. PepsiCo, which employs 30,000 locals, is for now improbably benefiting from a Russian ban on food imports from Europe and the United States, analysts say. PepsiCo makes and bottles most products locally, while competitors are stopped at the border. “We have manufacturing operations across Russia, and almost all of our products sold in Russia are made in Russia,” Pepsi said in a statement. But those assets could make PepsiCo vulnerable. The company, which has invested about $9 billion in Russia, owns the largest dairy in the country and is the largest processor of potatoes. Making the case for its local impact hasn’t helped McDonald’s, which owns all but one of its locations in the country. Some restaurants have reopened since the spot inspections, and McDonald’s was able to defeat the suit seeking to ban certain products. But the situation is marring perceptions. A recent poll by the Public Opinion Foundation showed that 49 percent of Russians want McDonald’s closed in Russia for serving unhealthy foods or squeezing out local restaurants, or as a justified response to United States sanctions. Ten of the chain’s 451 outlets remain closed. Among them is the flagship location on Pushkin Square in Moscow. That restaurant signified a watershed moment in the country’s economic history when it opened in 1990, creating huge lines. In the foreword of “To Russia With Fries,” a memoir by the founder of the Russian McDonald’s business, George Cohon, the former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev praised the chain’s arrival. “The merry clowns, the Big Mac signs, the colorful, unique decorations and ideal cleanliness in and around the restaurants, the welcoming smiles and helpful service — all of this complements the hamburgers whose great popularity is well deserved.” That restaurant, he wrote, “demonstrated that new economic relations between our country and the rest of the world were possible.” To make its case to authorities, McDonald’s is drawing on such ties. The closings have idled or forced the company to transfer about 1,000 of its 40,000 Russian employees. The eight ingredients in a Big Mac — two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions and a sesame seed bun — are all sourced from Russia. “The Big Mac is Russian,” said a McDonald’s spokeswoman, Svetlana Polyakova.","articleSrc":"NYT","articleHeader":"In Ukraine Crisis, U.S. Businesses Face Tit-for-Tat Response to Sanctions"}

Russia has long dismissed Western allegations that its military has intervened in Ukraine as little more than computer-generated propaganda. In an attempt to puncture the Russian denials, independent experts have operated like digital Sherlock Holmeses, using Google’s Street View, YouTube, Instagram, Twitter, satellite photographs and Russia’s version of Facebook, including social media updates by Russian soldiers. That research was then supplemented by more traditional sources like court documents and local media reports. “Independent researchers, using open sources and rigorous methodology, have demonstrated that Russian troops and Russian weapons have been an important part of the fight in Ukraine’s east,” said John E. Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine and one of the authors of the report, Hiding in Plain Sight: Putin’s War in Ukraine, which is to be released Thursday by the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based research center. While the most recent photograph analyzed in the Atlantic Council report was taken in February, Jens Stoltenberg, NATO’s secretary general, said in an interview in Washington on Wednesday that there was ample evidence that Russia still had forces in Ukraine and was sending arms to separatists there. “Russia is present in eastern Ukraine,” Mr. Stoltenberg said. “This is something we have from our own intelligence. But in addition to our own intelligence, it is based on open sources.” The report comes as European nations are preparing to vote next month on whether to ease or maintain economic sanctions on Russia because of its role in Ukraine. “The way Russian propaganda works, it makes it seem you can’t possibly know the truth,” said Eliot Higgins, a British-based researcher who founded the investigative website Bellingcat.com and led the effort to analyze the imagery for the Atlantic Council report. “If you try to counter it by doing the same thing, you are just adding to the noise. But you can get to the truth by pointing to the open source data and what’s publicly available.” Analyzing photographs of large craters in Ukraine and videos of rocket launches on nearby Russian territory, the Atlantic Council report concludes that Russian units have fired across the Ukrainian border. The report finds that craters near the Ukrainian town Panchenkove were the result of Russian multiple rocket fire near Gukovo, Russia, and from a separate site in eastern Ukraine. “Four videos containing geotags filmed in different locations in and around Gukovo showed the launch of rockets,” the report said. “Cross-border attacks served as cover for a renewed military incursion in the summer of 2014.” Geotags can show where images and videos were created. Drawing on satellite photographs and social media posts by Russian soldiers, the report shows the network of Russian military camps that have sprouted near the Ukrainian border and have been used to send Russian weapons and troops into eastern Ukraine. The camps, the report notes, are in plain view to “anyone with access to Google Earth or Google Maps.” Using YouTube video, the report tracked the movement of Russian convoys, including armored vehicles and self-propelled artillery. In one case, the report notes, a Russian military convoy was filmed moving in August through Staraya Stanitsa, Russia. In February, a YouTube channel associated with Russian-backed Ukrainian separatists showed an armored vehicle from the same convoy in Ukraine. By using satellite imagery and separate photographs of Russian equipment, the report also documents the movement of Russian tanks, SA-22 air-defense systems, Grad rocket launchers and armored reconnaissance vehicles. American officials have at times used photographs to buttress their claims of Russian intervention. When Secretary of State John Kerry met with President Vladimir V. Putin in Sochi, Russia, this month, Mr. Kerry showed him photographs of Russian air defenses and other weapons in eastern Ukraine to try to persuade him that the United States had clear evidence of Russia’s military role, Western officials said. Last year, NATO also issued satellite photographs of Russian artillery positions inside Ukraine to support its allegations of Russian involvement. But the photographs Mr. Kerry showed Mr. Putin have not been made public. Russian officials, who have repeatedly portrayed Ukraine’s new government as the main obstacle to a political settlement, have dismissed NATO’s public evidence as misinformation. Mr. Stoltenberg declined to say how many Russian troops were in Ukraine or positioned near its border. But one Western official, who asked not to be identified because he was discussing intelligence reports, said Russia had moved about nine battalion tactical groups close to its border with Ukraine, and that as many as five additional battalions could be sent there in coming weeks. The number of troops in such units can vary, but a battalion could have about 1,000 troops, creating a potential force of well over 10,000 Russian troops in Ukraine by this summer. It is unclear if Russia is preparing for a major offensive to help Ukrainian separatists seize more territory or if it is trying to put pressure on the Ukrainian government to make more constitutional concessions. Either way, the moves by Russia’s military are a violation of the peace agreement that was negotiated in Minsk, Belarus, in February, which called for the removal of foreign troops, the pulling back of heavy weapons and the disbanding of “illegal groups.” Vice President Joseph R.

Speaking in Kiev, the capital, Col. Andriy Lysenko, a Ukrainian military spokesman, said 32 tanks, 16 howitzers and 30 trucks hauling ammunition and fighters had crossed into the Luhansk region from Russia. He presented no clear evidence to support the claim, nor did the wealth of social media outlets in eastern Ukraine display any footage of a tank convoy. The Kiev government frequently made such claims that could not be substantiated during intense fighting between Ukrainian government troops and separatists earlier this year. Neither NATO nor the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is monitoring a cease-fire, could confirm the report. NATO issued a statement in Brussels saying it had noticed increased military activity along the frontier. “We can confirm a recent increase in Russian troops and equipment along the eastern border of Ukraine,” the statement said. “Russia continues to demonstrate its lack of regard for international agreements and its determination to further destabilize Ukraine.” The Ukrainian military issued a separate statement saying it had killed up to 200 rebel fighters, and destroyed a variety of military equipment, in the  continuing battle \nover the airport outside Donetsk, which Ukrainian government forces control. Andrei Purgin, the deputy prime minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, accused the government forces of starting an “all-out war” against the separatist fighters, according to a report from Russia’s state-controlled RIA Novosti news agency on Thursday. More than 4,000 people have been killed since the fighting erupted in April, according to United Nations figures. Tensions escalated after the two separatist city-states, Donetsk and Luhansk, held leadership elections on Sunday. The government in Kiev, which called the elections illegal, moved to cut off the regions physically and financially. It revoked a law that would have given the two regions some autonomy. Taken together, the various steps made prospects for a peaceful settlement look weaker than they have since before a tentative peace plan, including a cease-fire, was signed on Sept. 5. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called a meeting of his security chiefs to discuss the deteriorating situation late Thursday, but no new measures were announced afterward. Mr. Putin has said nothing about the separatist elections. Russia denies arming the rebels, and the government, while supporting the elections, stopped short of recognizing them, a step that might well prompt further economic sanctions by Europe. Russia is wrestling with a steep drop in oil prices that continues, along with the tension in Ukraine, to push the ruble to record lows against the dollar. In Moscow, a senior presidential aide, Yuri Ushakov, drew a careful line around the Kremlin’s position on Friday, saying that while it “respected” the outcome of the vote, that did not amount to recognition. “These are different words,” Mr. Ushakov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies. “The word ‘respect’ was chosen deliberately.” Mr. Ushakov said the government still supported the cease-fire agreement and expected negotiations on its further implementation to continue. “But not everything depends on us,” he was quoted as saying. “There are a lot of factors.” The often ambiguous Russian position has left many analysts to conclude that Moscow seeks to create a “frozen conflict” in eastern Ukraine that would continue to destabilize the entire country, ensuring Moscow’s continued influence and complicating Kiev’s goal of drawing closer to Europe. Mr. Putin is expected to meet a variety of European and Asian leaders, and possibly President Obama, on the sidelines of conferences in China and Australia next week. (On Friday, The Advocate, the gay and lesbian newsmagazine based in Los Angeles, named Mr. Putin, who has broadly denounced gay rights, person of the year., saying he was the “single greatest threat” to gays worldwide in 2014.) Among other issues, leaders are expected to discuss the investigation into the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine in July. Russia has accused Ukraine of shooting down the plane, while Western leaders have said it was most certainly shot down by Ukrainian separatists wielding a Russian surface-to-air missile. A new attempt to move all the wreckage to the Netherlands, where the flight originated and which is leading the investigation, was suspended on Friday after more human remains were found, according to Donetsk separatists quoted by Russia’s Tass news agency.","articleSrc":"NYT","articleHeader":"Ukraine Accuses Russia of Sending Tanks Across Border"}

It goes like this. Vladimir Putin’s Russia makes nice over an Iran nuclear deal. It is helpful in every way. A recent headline on a piece by my colleague David Sanger read, “Role for Russia Gives Iran Talks a Possible Boost.” In return, the United States turns a blind eye to the big Russian military build-up on the Ukrainian border and in areas under the control of Moscow-backed rebel separatists. I am not suggesting there is any such formal Iran-Ukraine trade-off between the Obama administration and Putin. I am suggesting that the Russian leader has a keen eye for American weakness and an exquisite sense of timing. The abrupt flaring of new fighting in eastern Ukraine, and the abrupt Russian readiness to help on Iran ahead of the Nov. 24 deadline for nuclear talks, are not a mere coincidence. They are part of a Russian strategy and, for now, the United States is playing along. An Iran nuclear deal would be good for the United States, Iran and the world. President Obama understands its importance, hence his recent reported letter to the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. An accord could place all Iran’s irreversible nuclear capacity in a limited and verifiable box, ensuring there is never an Iranian bomb, while ushering the last sizeable emerging market nation into the global economy. It would change the blocked politics of the Middle East, confounding America’s enemies and forcing sometimes manipulative allies to think in new and perhaps constructive ways. The deal, at this point, represents the last hope for any significant Obama legacy in the Middle East. It is clear that he wants it. But the unspoken price of an Iran deal, vital as it is, cannot be the loss of Ukraine and the unraveling of NATO. Putin has already annexed Crimea despite Russia’s signed agreement in 1994 “to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.” There is every reason to believe he has designs on all Ukraine. The West’s mistake has been to think that Putin is not serious in wishing to reconstitute the Soviet Union in new guise. The current Russian buildup has all the signs of preparation for an offensive. Large, unmarked convoys of heavy weapons and tanks manned by personnel without insignia on their uniforms (like those who took over Crimea) have been seen rumbling toward the front lines in rebel-held territory. Sophisticated artillery and ground-to-air missile systems have been moved into position. Units all the way from the east and far north of Russia have been massed. You don’t move military units thousands of miles for nothing. A retired NATO general who recently held talks with the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, told me that intelligence estimates are of some 45,000 regular Russian troops on the border; tens of thousands of Russian irregulars of various stripes inside Ukraine organized by a smaller number of Russian officers and military personnel; some 450 battle tanks and over 700 pieces of artillery. “Ukraine has no real fighting capacity to face all this,” he said. “They think we’re their friends and don’t understand why we won’t help them. They are frustrated and afraid because they can see a hammer coming at them.” In response to Putin’s hammer, the West has expressed concern. The United States National Security Council spokeswoman has said, “We are very concerned.” The European Union has called the reports of convoys of heavy weapons “very worrying.” Concern and worry do not stop a hammer. Poroshenko’s requests to Obama for substantial American military assistance should not have been rejected. Watch Putin’s actions. Be very wary of his words. That is the lesson of the past year. It has not been learned. It is nice that the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, and Secretary of State John Kerry have just agreed to exchange information on Ukraine and called for respect for a September cease-fire that is unraveling in the smoke and fire of Donetsk. It is also meaningless. Lavrov feigns the innocent on the military buildup. That’s his good-cop role. The reality is dangerous. A quarter-century after the fall of the Berlin Wall, as balloons go up in the German capital, a nation of 45 million people that wants to enjoy the fruits of European freedom is being abandoned to Russian dismemberment. If that happens, if Ukraine is lost, America’s promise to its NATO allies in the Baltics and Eastern Europe is not going to be viewed as credible. A core Russian strategic objective since 1945 — the decoupling of American and European defense — will be on its way to realization. I just hope the refrain inside the White House is not: “We can’t annoy the Russians on Ukraine. They’re being helpful on Iran. We won’t get a deal without them.” But I wouldn’t bet on it. An Iran-Ukraine affair is plausible.","articleSrc":"NYT","articleHeader":"The Iran-Ukraine Affair"}

How do you feel about this story?Richard Spencer: I would first point out that this Ynet story is actually the number one story on Google news when you google Russia and Syria. So this is not some alternative media blog – this is a major part of the propaganda war. In some ways it comes out of an alternative universe, and it is not coming from universe we live in. Russia, as opposed to the US, has been the power that has really stressed stability, and stressed diplomacy. Russia has prevented a war in Syria in 2013, or at least you could say that it played indispensable role in preventing what would be yet another catastrophic endless conflict in that region. Yes, I think it’s a part of a propaganda war, it is part of a certain faction in the US that wants the Shia and Sunni to be going at it endlessly, that actually wants chaos in the region, that thinks that it is good for Israel, or some other’s interest. The whole point about a propaganda war is of course not that it is true, and it is not even that you can’t debunk it later; the whole point of the propaganda war is to get it out there. So you have things like “weapons of mass destruction,” you have things like “Vladimir Putin ordered a plane to be shut down in Ukraine,” and so on, and so on. These things can be disproven; these things turn out to be bogus. But the whole point is to get them out there. They are kind of percolating throughout the media and through people’s minds in the west. And that is mainly what the story was about.\n                    Gorlovka residents near an apartment building on Kirova Street damaged during a night shelling by the Ukrainian military. © Iliya Pitalev / RIA Novosti     \n                RT:In many cases, like in the aforementioned story, the alleged evidence proved to be bogus. Why supposedly credible news organizations are not doing fact-checking before publication?RS: Unfortunately, not all news organizations are really concerned about the truth and about getting it right, and about digging in. There are certainly a lot of news organizations that are simply interested in sensation for sensation sake. But also there is quite a bit of organizations that are really connected with governments and connected with specific factors or movements within governments. You can see this with the conservative media in the US – they have a very specific foreign policy agenda; they are going to report on the “facts” in a way that supports that agenda. And that agenda, of course, is more war that they think will benefit the US or Israel. But you have to think: the media is very often an arm of governments, an arm of movements within governments. And that is most likely what we’re seeing today with this Ynet story.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        Bogus reports as part of Western media war\n\n     \n\n    "}

Would you agree with that assessment of Maidan?READ MORE: Kiev clashes, grenade explosion injure dozens during protests against constitutional lawRoger Annis: No not at all. In fact there is a growing body of evidence that researchers into the events on Maidan Square are showing that there was extreme violence practiced by the right-wing forces that were striving to overthrow the elected president at that time, and specifically the use of sniper fire on February 20. Now there is considerable evidence, including in the official investigation ongoing in the Ukraine itself, that the sniper fire that was blamed on the police of the government that was overthrown in fact came from the right-wing side. So that the right wing practices violence is no mystery to anyone, but perhaps these latest events in Kiev will give more impetus to a real and serious investigation into the extremely violent events on Maidan Square on February 20 and the days and weeks leading up to that.James Petras, Professor of Sociology at Binghamton University on latest protests in Kiev: “It’s very clear that economically Ukraine is a basket case. Internally the Kiev regime is deeply divided and increasingly the conflicts are becoming violent. Svoboda and Right Sector groups have become very belligerent and are challenging the government’s authority. I think the outside survival link is what holds Poroshenko in power. Without that… and the legislation to try to decentralize some of the issues that confront the country is a way of retaining outside support which is so necessary since Poroshenko has more or less lost it internally.”RT: Back in January last year the US State Department even considered sanctions against the previous Yanukovich government for using force on Maidan square. Why was the attitude to Yanukovich so different when he tried to get his country in order?RA: Precisely, and in fact let’s take that a little bit further. When we look at the so called violence that was carried out on Maidan Square for those months before the overthrow of the elected president, violence coming from the government… I'm not going to sit here and defend all the actions of the Yanukovich government, but they are grossly exaggerated. And at the same time the violence coming from the right-wing side striving to overthrow the government has been - as we are seeing by the reaction today from the State Department - has been mysteriously downgraded in a complete whitewash and cover-up, as I said the growing body of evidence about the sniper fire. So what we saw on Maidan Square was the unraveling of a conspiracy. And that requires a lot of evidence to be hushed up and silenced and it requires a massive media propaganda effort to convince the world that something rather opposite to what was taking place on Maidan Square, that a violent right wing uprising against an elected president was taking place. The US can't sell that to the world, they can't say “we supported a violent right wing protest against an elected president.” They have that … fictional narrative of the actual events. And you know we're seeing today the very forces that were out there on Maidan Square 18 months ago, we see them in action again. And now this government is really reaping the whirlwind of the conspiracy that it was a part of it months ago.James Petras, Professor of Sociology at Binghamton University on latest protests in Kiev: “This could be the second Maidan too and it reflects that the government came to power illegitimately through violence and now is facing its own violent internal opposition. If Svoboda comes to power it will create turmoil on the borders, because these extremist groups look toward a confrontation with Russia, Belarus, and Moldova. It is an extremist group which has no understanding of the international alignments today.”RT: Can these protests involving radicals escalate? And do you think Washington will back Poroshenko's government till the very end?RA: I'm not sure how much further this can go. The extreme right in Ukraine is in no position to overthrow this government in Kiev. This could not be solved internationally, not in the slightest. And so I think the right wing is making its points, we may see more of these violent protests, but they are in no position to overthrow the government. Now the government on the other hand [has got to use peaceful means] because it has obligations under the Minsk II ceasefire agreement which it is failing to carry out, including this proposed decentralization law, which is for the most part is an evasion by the Kiev government of its responsibilities and obligations under Minsk II.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.LISTEN MORE:","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        ‘Right wing practicing violence in Ukraine no mystery to anyone’\n\n     \n\n    "}

And all the perpetrators, organizers, all political forces will face a severe punishment,” Poroshenko said.According to the president, “the threat of break-up of the international pro-Ukrainian coalition” would have increased if the Verkhovna Rada had not voted in favor of decentralization amendments to the constitution on Monday.It could also lead to the lifting of sanctions, which “are very painfully hitting the aggressor,” he said, apparently, referring to Russia, which Kiev blames for sending troops to war-torn eastern Ukraine.“Amendments to the constitution don’t mean the loss of territory,” Poroshenko said, explaining that, on the contrary, they’re giving a chance to bring back Donetsk and Lugansk regions under Ukrainian rule “via political and diplomatic means.”“We will achieve victory, combining strengthening national defense with political and diplomatic efforts,” he promised.The president pointed out that the new amendments are far from those which the rebelling regions desired from any constitutional reform.“What they wanted was no federalization, but a confederation, which would’ve seen dozens of Ukrainian regions having closer links with Russia than Ukraine. Therefore, there were dreams about the militants to be able to influence key foreign policy decisions, having the right to veto the entry of Ukraine into NATO and the EU,\" he explained.“But what they [Donetsk and Lugansk Regions] have got instead is a lean line about the features of local self-governance,” Poroskenko stressed.The amendments saw all the provisions for “a theoretical possibility of a special status for individual cities” excluded from the constitution in order to eliminate “the slightest legal clues for the parade of sovereignty,\" he added.As for Donetsk and Lugansk, the local self-governance there is provided by a separate law, which “has already been approved by the parliament on two occasions,” Poroshenko said.“Most of the articles of this law are now suspended.

However, that figure suddenly jumped more than 20-fold, as Poroshenko told Italy’s Corriere della Sera in June that “on Putin’s order, there are 200,000 men and an arsenal of armored vehicles, sophisticated missile systems and anti-air arms amassed in our territory.”READ MORE: From 9,000 to 200,000: Poroshenko’s displays numeracy problem in counting ‘Russian invaders’The Ukrainian president has never provided any proof to back his claims, with Moscow denying its military presence in eastern Ukraine on numerous occasions.Moreover, OSCE observers monitoring the border between the two countries have said that they have never seen Russian military personnel or vehicles crossing into Ukraine.But it’s not just Kiev, but also Washington, that is finding it hard to obtain reliable intelligence from the Donetsk and Lugansk Regions.In May, US Permanent Representative to NATO, Douglas Lute, admitted that his knowledge of the eastern Ukrainian conflict came mostly from social media.READ MORE: US NATO envoy: ‘I get most info on Ukraine conflict from social networks’“We should all ask ourselves: why is it that we know so little really about what is going on in Donbass [eastern Ukraine],” Lute told the Friends of Europe Forum in Brussels, Belgium.“I mean, frankly, I read more on social media about what is going on in the Donbass than I get from formal intelligence networks. This is because the networks don’t exist today,” he added.In an earlier intel mishap, US ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey Pyatt, resorted to posting a two-year-old picture of an air defense system from an air show near Moscow as proof of Russia’s increasing presence in Donbass.C серпня це найвища концентрація російських систем ППО на сході України. pic.twitter.com/4M1VJ9fvQX— Geoffrey Pyatt (@GeoffPyatt) April 23, 2015Pyatt also released forged satellite images on his Twitter last year, which allegedly showed Ukraine being shelled from Russian territory.LISTEN MORE:","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        90% of Kiev’s Donbass intel last summer ‘appeared untrue’ – Ukrainian General Staff \n\n     \n\n    "}

They consume American TV and movies. Teenagers in Siberia follow the street fashion of New York. Even in isolated Yakutia you will find people who can rap along to Kanye West or Jay Z. Many older people can manage a few bars of Elvis or Sinatra.The reverse is not true in the States. Few Americans could quote a bit of Pushkin. In fact, most US citizens have probably not even heard of him. Or Pasternak. Or Tolstoy. Regrettably, if you ask an average American for an opinion on Russia, the current likely answer is something that depicts the nation as their enemy.This is very, very sad. Especially when Russia has no desire to be an enemy of the US and is not a threat to any genuine American interests. Actually, Russia is not even much of a danger to most of the things it’s supposed to be a danger to. Like the Baltic States, for instance. Or the EU project.However, relentless anti-Russia propaganda in the US corporate media has brought us to this point. American elites are now more united in their disdain for Russia than they ever were during the Cold War. During that period, dissenting voices were heard. Now, they are completely frozen out.Indeed, anybody with any real knowledge of Russia is condemned as “Putin’s shill” these days. Even academic heavyweights like Stephen Cohen. Thus, we have the bizarre situation where most American mainstream media commentators on Russia are people who have either never lived in the country or haven’t been there for years. Or both. If old Joe McCarthy himself was around, he’d be on CNN every five minutes.\n                   Soldiers from the first company-sized contingent of about 150 U.S. paratroopers from the U.S. Army's 173rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team in Swidwin, northern west Poland April 23, 2014. © Kacper Pempel / Reuters     \n                Nasty neoconsThe fact that genuine Russia analysts, who understand the country, have been replaced by neocon nutters who lump the nation in with the likes of Syria, ISIS and North Korea is, frankly, disturbing. Russia is not some martial lightweight; it’s the globe’s second strongest military power. Or maybe that’s the whole point? Russia is bigger and scarier than the aforementioned and presenting it as an imminent danger is more likely to secure increases in defense spending?It’s also interesting to note that, almost to a man (or woman), the media figures calling for confrontation with Russia are the same people who pushed for conflict with Iraq, Libya and Syria.The current climate is toxic. Washington-Moscow relations are at all time low. The media, in both countries, fuels the tension. Yet, to understand where we are, we first need to understand how we got here.The American establishment hates Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. For daring to challenge Washington’s authority, he’s been designated as the bad guy du jour. With Bin Laden and Saddam dead, many imagined that North Korea’s Kim Jong-un would inherit this role. However, unlike Al Qaeda, North Korea is too weak and insular to threaten the US directly. To preserve the military budget, which increased dramatically since 2001, they need an existential danger. Russia fits the bill.It wasn’t always like this. After Bin Laden’s henchmen attacked the US on September 11, 2001, Putin was the first foreign leader to call President George W Bush. He offered what the US needed and far more than any NATO members did. Intelligence, supplies, access to central Asia and transit across Russian territory. Putin even threw in the Northern Alliance to help America defeat the Taliban. This wasn’t popular with the Russian elite.Before Putin, the 90s-era Boris Yeltsin government bent over backward to help the US. Indeed, Yeltsin even gave Bill Clinton a map of the electronic bugs in the US embassy in Moscow as a sign of friendship. At this stage, NATO had just 12 member states to resist the “Soviet threat.”How did the Bush administration repay Russian loyalty? They continued to expand NATO eastward, despite assurances to the last Soviet government that it would never happen. Now, NATO comprises 28 countries - and there are a few more on its waiting list.\n                   U.S. Army soldiers train during an exercise at the Adazi Training Area, Latvia. © U.S. Army / Sgt. Stephen A. Gober / Reuters     \n                America continued to support every country and politician who portrayed themselves as a potential victim of Russia. While Putin was trying to foster a new era of cooperation, Washington just couldn’t tear itself away from Cold War thinking. Kremlin bad, Kremlin’s enemies good.Since the turn of the century, politicians in ex-USSR states have had a clear path to riches. Simply sound as anti-Russian as possible and voila, money and support beyond their wildest dreams will suddenly appear, all thanks to Uncle Sam. The formula is repeated time and time again. Thus, we have the bizarre situation where US taxpayers are bankrolling a smorgasbord of ex-Communists, neo-Nazis and corrupt oligarchs across the former Soviet Union.Russia has responded by developing ties with leaders opposed to the US. Syria’s Assad, Venezuela’s Chavez and Hungary’s Orban. Again, a nonlinear combination of conflicting left-wingers and their right-wing opposites. Amid all these geopolitical games, it’s like the Reagan-Gorbachev detente never happened. That said, Russia has so far restrained itself from actively supporting American enemies. If US hostility encourages Moscow to change tack, expect a run on tinned food and a Bay Of Pigs redux.Bought journalismAlas, US aggression appears to be intensifying. In this year’s State of the Union speech, President Obama named only one country as an American enemy - Russia. The other adversary mentioned was ISIL.In an earlier address, he also equated Russia to the Ebola virus. A gloating Obama claimed that Russia’s economy was “in tatters” and that the state was “isolated.” Neither of these statements is true. In actual fact, in many regions - including Asia and Latin America - Russia has more friends than the US.Incessant propaganda reduces hopes of a thaw. Especially when most popular western press seems to simply regurgitate the government line these days. Again, the same useful idiots who shilled for the illegal Iraq war now turn their sights to Russia. For evidence of this, see Gekaufte Journalisten (Bought Journalism) by German journalist Udo Ulfkotte. In the bestseller, the former editor at Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung explains how many stories in the German media are essentially planted by the CIA.At the same time, anti-Russia rhetoric in the US reaches new levels. Americans are bombarded with daily fear-mongering propaganda about “Russian aggression.” This is particularly pronounced on Fox News and CNN, where figures such as retired Major General Robert Scales bombard the airwaves daily. Scales recently called for America \"to start killing Russians ... killing so many Russians that even Putin's media can't hide the fact that Russians are returning to the motherland in body bags.”Oddly, Russia is reducing media spending. This year, TASS news agency announced a 25 percent staff reduction and Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the state’s official publication service (which also oversees Russia Beyond The Headlines and Russia Direct in foreign languages), released 10 percent of its employees. Also, RT's budget is down 46 percent in dollar terms this year.Shaken, not stirredMeanwhile. Putin is smeared as a cross between a new Hitler and a James Bond villain. The Russian president is accused of nostalgia for the Soviet Union. In reality, Putin is a Russian nationalist. Indeed, his political mentor was Anatoly Sobchak, a noted and outspoken opponent of communism. Putin’s KGB past is also frequently used against him. In fact, the President was a low-ranking administrator, not a *Stirlitz-esque spy.LISTEN MORE:Putin himself believes that the west is implementing a policy of “containment” against Russia. Even the “shadow-CIA,” US-political intelligence firm Stratfor broadly agrees with this assessment. The agency’s chief, George Friedman, has often stated that US policy is to prevent a rival power emerging in Eurasia. In simple terms, this means that Washington loves Moscow when it’s weak, as in the 90s, but fears a successful Russia which could rival it.Hence, the Kremlin now realises that using cooperation with the west to fuel economic growth is futile. This explains Russia’s enthusiasm for the BRICs movement. It has also led to a nascent alliance with China, one that may not be in Moscow’s long-term interests. However, Putin has calculated that the alternative, meekly cowering before Washington, is worse.As Moscow-Washington relations atrophy, there are now two scenarios in play. America can continue its aggression and Putin, a moderate by Russian standards, could feel compelled to dust off the Soviet playbook. This would mean a tit-for-tat campaign to destabilise America's near abroad as Washington has done, or attempted to do, in Ukraine, Georgia, Armenia and Moldova. The far better option would be for the US to take a step back and attempt a rapprochement with Moscow before the present acrimony becomes systemic.*Stirlitz (Maxim Maximovich Isaev) was a fictional Soviet spy, created by Yulian Semyonov.

Forbes published an article on Wednesday citing a Russian web source Business Life (Delovaya Zhizn) which revealed “official figures on the number of Russian soldiers killed or made invalids in eastern Ukraine.” RT later received an e-mail purportedly from the editorial board of Business Life claiming the publication had been hacked.READ MORE: Who slipped? How fake report on ‘Russian soldier deaths’ in Ukraine set MSM on fireRT: What do you make of this e-mail we received?Eric Draitser: It’s really hard to say exactly who it came from and what the motivation behind it is. Perhaps it’s an attempt to discredit what RT has reported, what other news outlets have reported; perhaps it is an attempt to walk back away from these wild accusations, these unfounded allegations that have been put out there into the blogosphere and into the online media world without any substantiation.It is unclear exactly what has happened here. But I think the larger question, the one that really comes to my mind immediately is: what has happened to the standards of journalism, especially in the so-called trusted Western media?If you look at a number of examples in the context of Ukraine, whether it was the rush to blame Russia and Putin for downing flight MH17; whether it was the purported Russian tanks crossing the border of Ukraine, as The Guardian and many others have reported. We’ve seen over, and over, and over again a pattern of lies, distortions and exaggerations that have been perpetrated by the Western media not simply because they want to plant these facts, although it’s part of it, but it is to drive a particular narrative, it is to drive the political agenda of the US and its Western allies where they are in need to make Russia into a villain, and the West into the backers and supporters of ‘good guys’. Because that narrative has fallen away, because it is broken down so much, now they are moving to even more underhanded tactics, as we’ve seen in recent days.RT: Are claims like this potentially damaging to the ongoing peace process in Ukraine?ED: On the one hand, they can certainly shift some political opinion or, rather I should say, public opinion, although political opinion as well. I think at the larger level it’s mostly irrelevant as it pertains to the powers that would be negotiating such a settlement. The real question, perhaps, is the main hurdle to any kind of a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine is simply the fact that the so-called government of Kiev is clearly and unmistakably a puppet government of the US and of the West, one that is holding on for dear life as an economy crashes around it, as it has a public in Ukraine that is increasingly discontented, increasingly dissatisfied, and increasingly becoming radicalized. Those Nazi groups, the Pravy Sektor [Right Sector] and the Azov Battalion, and all of the rest of these fascist organizations have tremendous sway in Ukraine, they have tremendous fire power behind them. I think the real obstacle to peace isn’t so much some fake report from Forbes or from some obscure Russian website – it is these elements who will stop at nothing to get the war that they want and that they have lost all along.\n                   © Igor Zarembo / RIA Novosti     \n                ‘Internet creates presumption of correctness’Legal analyst and media commentator Lionel suggests that the better the website, graphics and layout, the more it’s trusted. People and journalists are not going to figure out and verify the validity of that which they report, he adds.RT: This information has not been verified, but is already been widely reported as fact. What do you make of that?Lionel: I’m surprised it took this long. I’m surprised we haven’t found more of this. I’m surprised for a variety of reasons. Look there is a presumption of correctness that people have. The better the site, the better the graphics, the better the layout - the more it’s trusted. We are now in a world that turns to Wikipedia as an absolute fact basis, after all its Wikipedia. Then we have satire sites, we have the Onion here, where people have sometimes confused the Onion with actual news. Sometimes people have actually cited deliberately bogus and satirical sites because there is a presumption of correctness, a presumption of legitimacy…RT: So you are not surprised at the lack of questions from some major publications?L: That’s the point that gets me and if you look at the provenance of this author you would think that especially when the subject matter is such that is by its very nature very intriguing and very shocking you would think there would be a little bit of an inquiry just to play it safe. But the internet and the graphics have created the illusion. Again a presumption of correctness. And what we are going to find out is - more and more of these stories, of these websites, are going to be set up in the hope that nobody will check them….    RT: Will it extend to the wider public as well, will this? If you sensed when you’ve seen this story and talk to the public about it, have you sensed that they are sort of appalled by what they see as well or are they just pushing it to one side saying that this thing happens?L: No, nothing appalls it. Listen to give you an example - there is a joke on the internet that says “Never believe everything you read on the internet,” and it cites Abraham Lincoln. It’s a joke and it shows you the inherent irony and the satire of that. Do you know how many people I’ve seen actually cite that? Abraham Lincoln referring to the internet? Because there is again this presumption of correctness. I can tell you every single day there is a story that is absolutely absurd and you will read online in various social media - which is another story - where people say “No, this is satirical”. When the Onion started here in this country people didn’t know what it was because it looked like a newspaper, felt like a newspaper, it had the graphics of a newspaper and then again the presumption of such took place. So the good news is that maybe by virtue of this story and others it will force newsrooms around the world to look deeper and not necessarily believe everything they see. I hope.

According to a recent poll conducted by the independent Levada research center, 41 percent of Russians hold that the best way to tackle illegal migration was to help the refugees find jobs and receive legal status – twice as many as the 19 percent who gave the same answer just one year back.READ MORE: Thousands of Ukrainian citizens to sue Kiev regime over human rights violations – Russian activistsIn the same interview, Romodanovsky said that his agency was actively fighting illegal migration and over the past 2.5 years they have managed to detain and send back about 1.5 million people who tried to get on the Russian territory by bypassing the rules.In mid-June this year the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said that in 2014 the influx of Ukrainian citizens seeking refuge on Russian territory put the Russian Federation in first place in the world by number of asylum applications.The UN confirmed that the military conflict in Ukraine’s Donbass region was the main reason for the surge in asylum applications.

She could call on the British Labor candidate Jeremy Corbyn during the ongoing mud-slinging campaign against him, because Corbyn participated in the peace movement in the 1980s and thus can be suspected of being an idealist.But calling Mr. Kissinger a “useful idiot”, with his Cold War experience and a record of diplomatic victories over the Soviet Union - this would be too much of a stretch even for Applebaum.The team of pragmatic critics of Western support for Ukraine’s President Poroshenko includes not just Americans, but also former German chancellors Gerhard Schroeder and Helmut Schmidt. One might add to it Luc Ferry, the former French education minister, who accused the West of “inventing itself an enemy” in Russia, by presenting the tragedy of Ukraine as a confrontation “between good Ukrainians and bad Russians.” And if Gerhard Schroeder has long ago got accustomed to getting insults from the Western press because of his agreement to work for the Russo-German Nord Stream energy project, the American and German journalists will need to stretch themselves to find abasing motives for the position of the 96 years old ex-chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Speaking about the possible Russian intervention in eastern Ukraine, Schmidt said he “would consider it an error, if the West started acting as if [such an invasion] were necessarily the next step.”The problem is that the West is already acting as if Russia indeed invaded Ukraine, and not the three per cent of Ukrainian territory controlled by the Donbass rebels, but the entire country.\n                   Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko sings the national anthem during the Independence Day military parade, in the center of Kiev, Ukraine, August 24, 2015. © Gleb Garanich / Reuters     \n                A good indication of this sort of conduct on the side of the West is the recent announcement by the US Vice President Joe Biden that Washington would give Poroshenko $500 million more for the “training” of the Ukrainian National Guard (which consists of paramilitary battalions known for their cruelty and ethnic bias) by US instructors. This announcement, made in an official letter to the Ukrainian parliament, can be added to last year’s resolution of the US Congress, which authorized Obama’s administration to provide $350 million worth of military equipment to the Ukrainian army. The supposedly “non-lethal” equipment, mentioned in the resolution, includes anti-tank systems and “crew weapons,” while the friendly “training” includes classes in marksmanship. And after that Obama and Biden defy all the lie detectors talking about their “help” to the people of Donbass and “friendship” with the people of Russia. With such friends, who needs enemies?In his speech during the recent military parade in Kiev, Poroshenko said that by the end of the year the Ukrainian army would get over 300 armored vehicles and 400 combat vehicles, as well as 30,000 missiles and other munitions. Earlier, the Ukrainian Military Prosecutor’s office revealed that up to 8,000 Ukrainian servicemen defected to the rebels, most likely joining their ranks, since these “traitors” may face criminal charges in the regime-controlled areas of Ukraine.The conflict which started under the ousted president Viktor Yanukovich as a dispute over the timing of Ukraine’s joining the Association Agreement with the EU – has been blown by the West to the size of a major security threat to all of Europe, not just to Russia.In fact, this is the reason why Kissinger, Schmidt, Simes and other pragmatists are getting concerned. It is not humanism, but the instinct of self-preservation that is at work here. Total impunity for the past failures in Iraq, Libya or Syria is pushing US officials into even more dangerous adventures in Europe. As Dimitri Simes noted in his article “Foreign Policy by Bumper Sticker,” “it is difficult to recall a nominee for any high-level national security position who has failed to win Senate confirmation, or even encountered significant criticism, for advocating or implementing ill-fated interventions. In contrast, many nominees have endured withering criticism for purportedly “soft” stances on exercising American global leadership by force.”With such Senate requirements, which candidate will defend the peace?LISTEN MORE:","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        ‘Old guard’ pragmatists criticize Western policy on Ukraine\n\n     \n\n    "}

The task at hand means that what we agreed in Minsk has to be respected,” Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters on Monday, referring to the February peace plan based on an OSCE-brokered agreement between Kiev and self-proclaimed rebel republics in eastern Ukraine.Merkel insisted that the Berlin meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and French President Francois Hollande had been called to help “implement the Minsk deal, not to call it into question.”'Pacifism over': #Poroshenko presents tanks, Humvees, weaponry to #Donbass forces (VIDEO) https://t.co/AUXhYqVstxpic.twitter.com/7XxZIzNGQB— RT (@RT_com) August 22, 2015The German leader said that Poroshenko has assured her of Kiev’s commitment to withdrawing weaponry from the front line of the conflict – and a readiness to pull back weapons under 100mm in caliber. While the withdrawal of lighter weaponry was not outlined in the Minsk deal, eastern Ukrainian rebel forces unilaterally pulled back arms of less than 100mm caliber at the end of July, saying it was an act of good will in the hope that Kiev would follow suit.According to Merkel, a broader arms withdrawal was recently discussed in a telephone conversation between the leaders of the ‘Normandy Four’ – France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.Both Kiev and the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics have been blaming each other for frequent ceasefire violations, including the use of heavy weaponry that they had agreed to pull back under the Minsk Protocol. The OSCE monitoring mission has confirmed that both sides have violated the agreement. Shelling continues to hit parts of the densely populated city of Donetsk: in July, one person was killed and several others injured as Ukrainian forces shelled residential blocks and a city hospital. Overall, the conflict has claimed more than 6,700 lives since Kiev sent in the army in April of 2014 for what it called an “anti-terrorist operation.”Poroshenko ‘sought backing for all-out war’?However, it is the recent statements by Poroshenko that have been interpreted as signs of the imminent resumption of all-out war in the rebel-controlled areas. On Saturday, the Ukrainian leader bluntly stated that “the Minsk agreement despite all criticism has given us time to build up Ukraine’s defense,” adding that “the times of airheaded pacifism and shortsighted rejection of security issues are forever in the past now.”'Russians \u0026 Ukrainians NOT brothers' - Poroshenko http://t.co/2slkhXrY33pic.twitter.com/scjzYndZqD— RT (@RT_com) August 21, 2015With Poroshenko’s remarks coming on the eve of his meeting with Merkel and Hollande, Moscow reacted by saying it hoped that the European leaders would put pressure on Kiev to stick to the Minsk agreements.

It could also mean he is seeking to gain backing for a new military operation in eastern Ukraine.“I think Petro Poroshenko is just trying to get additional public support for what he’s being prepared to do, inside and outside Ukraine: a new push to resume war in Ukraine. So, I think he probably has the backing of his Western sponsors, and this is just something that needs to be more public… Obviously, the rhetoric that’s coming out of Kiev is that Minsk, the Minsk agreements, are pretty much dead,” Pavic told RT.#Putin goes to Crimea – but where’s the Western outrage?

Media reports, such as one published by the German agency dpa, suggested that fighting corruption in Ukraine was to be the focus of the agenda in Berlin.“Nobody’s serious about dealing with corruption in Ukraine. It’s obvious after more than a year, a year and a half of the war, ever since the Maidan, that, if anything, Ukraine is even more corrupt than it was. It’s now a place being run by the oligarchs, and it’s a much less democratic place than it was,” Pavic said, adding that the new Ukrainian authorities have only been consistent in their push for war in Donbass.READ MORE: ‘Ukraine Salvation Committee’ is worthy proposal as state not functioning anywayCalling Poroshenko’s Saturday statement on the Minsk deal “scandalous,” the analyst pointed to the lack of response coming from the West.“In effect, he’s saying that, “No, we weren’t interested in peace when we were negotiating the Minsk agreement. We were just interested in buying time because we were losing the war, and now that we are rearmed, we’re ready to resume the war.” Western capitals haven’t responded, and really needed to respond very negatively to Poroshenko’s statements if they were serious about real peace in Ukraine and the Minsk agreement… They’re actually encouraging Poroshenko to resume war,” Pavic said.","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        ‘Minsk peace deal on Ukraine must be respected’ – Merkel after talks with Poroshenko\n\n     \n\n    "}

Eventually Yatsulyak was sacked as “unfit” for the position, and later left the country.Even though he was never ordered to actually install anti-personnel mines, Yatsulyak speculates that Kiev eventually circumvented the law to deploy them, given the number of reports of deadly mine explosions in Donbass.An order for the transition of “engineering munitions” such as mines between the Ministry of Defense and the National Guard would be coming “very high level,” and if properly documented would leave a trail of paperwork, Yatsulyak says. But he does not rule out that the papers could have been destroyed to cover the tracks of the perpetrators.

It is mounted above ground level on the surface or in trees to give the greatest dispersion of fragments and impact radius.Both mines are illegal under the international Ottawa Treaty, as they can be indiscriminately activated potentially by non-combatants.Ukraine signed the so-called Mine Ban Treaty in 1999 and ratified it in 2005. Kiev’s deadline to destroy anti-personnel mines stockpiles passed on 1 June 2010, but as of 2015 over 5 million anti-personnel mines remained in its warehouses.In its technical briefing note released in April this year, Human Rights Watch (HRW), reviewed the types of landmines documented in the Ukraine conflict since early 2014, specifically focusing on antipersonnel mines.“While it is clear that antipersonnel mines were used on a limited and localized scale, it is not possible at this time to concretely determine the responsibility of any party for using antipersonnel mines,” HRW concluded.READ MORE: Ex-IDF fighter with E. Ukraine rebels says she is after ‘fascist, pro-Nazis and oligarchs’But as reports of their use in Donbass region keep surfacing, experts interviewed by RT seem to agree that anti-personnel mines could have easily been deployed by Kiev’s forces.Yatsulyak’s allegations are “plausible” professor of politics at the University of Rhode Island, Nikolai Petro, told RT. “There have been prior suggestions by international organizations that watch over the placement of such mines, that they are being used in this conflict, so it is certainly possible.”Although the Ottawa Treaty does offer “an exception” for the use of these weapons in the “state of war” and “specific combat situations,” Petro pointed out this is not the case, because “this is essentially a civil war, internal battle.”Even Kiev itself keeps referring to its military operations in the east of the country as an “anti-terrorist operation,” which according to the country’s own laws must performed by anti-terrorist units of the Interior Ministry without the participation of the army.Implementing illegal munitions, Petro says, would suggest that Kiev is not planning to “exert control over that area” and expects it to fall into “enemy hands.” Such a plan to “give up” on the region would certainly raise a debate in Ukraine, but Petro does not expect the official reaction to go beyond assurances that “the matter is under investigation.”Indeed, the Ukraine National Guard press service told RT that “as of yet [they] can neither confirm, nor deny this information,” adding that they first “need to check the documents issued at that time.”","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        Kiev ordered deployment of ‘illegal \u0026 inhumane’ anti-personnel mines – ex-Ukrainian officer\n\n     \n\n    "}

After the nationalist-driven armed coup in Kiev last year, the secession of predominantly-Russian Crimea and the uprising of rebel forces in the East, many of whom are ethnic Russians, the nationalist agenda was pushed to the top of political discourse in Ukraine.Poroshenko’s scathing remark came after a recent comment by Putin that Ukraine was currently under foreign governance and that it was humiliating to the Ukrainian people.

Some demography experts believe the actual figure may be higher, citing an unexpectedly sizeable 3-million decrease in the figure since the 1989 census and the fact that roughly a third of Ukrainian citizens considered Russian as their native language.Among the figures who promulgated the “we are not brothers” idea in Ukraine after the Maidan protests was the young poet Anastasia Dmitruk. A video of her reading her poem “We will never be brothers” praising Ukrainians and scorning Russians, has scored over 2.7 million views on YouTube since its publication in March last year, while a music video to the lyrics has surpassed 5.8 million.The sense of threat from Ukrainian nationalists felt by ethnic Russians was a key factor in prompting people in eastern Ukraine to defy Kiev and take up arms.

Ukrainian domestic politics made it look impossible for [former Ukrainian president Viktor] Yanukovych to accept the EU terms and be reelected or for Russia to view them as purely economic,” said Kissinger.This Kissinger interview in @TheNatlInterest is well worth reading http://t.co/8og25i9UQ5pic.twitter.com/y2zYL3hsku— Danielle Ryan (@DanielleRyanJ) August 20, 2015Once Yanukovich rejected the deal in November 2013, the EU “panicked”, Russia became “overconfident,” the US remained “passive” as “each side acted sort of rationally based on its misconception of the other” and “no significant political discussions.”For Kissinger, the wheels of the stand-off between Moscow and the West were already set in motion during the subsequent Maidan street protests – heartily endorsed by the West – which demanded the toppling of the pro-Russian Yanukovich, an aim that was eventually achieved.“While Ukraine slid into the Maidan uprising right in the middle of what Putin had spent ten years building as a recognition of Russia’s status. No doubt in Moscow this looked as if the West was exploiting what had been conceived as a Russian festival to move Ukraine out of the Russian orbit.”Obama, as his critics will remind you, did not seek to \"break\" Russia. We tried to Reset relations with Russia. Putin in 2012 rejected.— Michael McFaul (@McFaul) August 20, 2015With the armed conflict in Ukraine still showing no signs of resolution, Kissinger repeated his previous proposal for Ukraine to become a buffer, or mediator state between Russia and the West.“We should explore the possibilities of a status of nonmilitary grouping on the territory between Russia and the existing frontiers of NATO,” he told The National Interest. “The West hesitates to take on the economic recovery of Greece; it’s surely not going to take on Ukraine as a unilateral project. So one should at least examine the possibility of some cooperation between the West and Russia in a militarily nonaligned Ukraine.”While Kissinger insists that he believes that Ukraine’s territorial integrity, including Crimea, which joined Russia last year, should have remained unaffected, he called for the West to stop backing Kiev at all costs, even as the victims of the conflict pile up.“The Ukraine crisis is turning into a tragedy because it is confusing the long-range interests of global order with the immediate need of restoring Ukrainian identity,” summed up the veteran diplomat.LISTEN MORE:","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        Kissinger: ‘Breaking Russia has become objective for US’\n\n     \n\n    "}

These exercises are being conducted along as the conflict in eastern Ukraine escalates.READ MORE: US launches biggest NATO airborne drills since Cold War to ‘enhance security \u0026 stability’ in Europe RT: What effect do NATO's war games have on the Minsk peace agreement in East Ukraine?Michael Parenti: I think that NATO’s campaign in Ukraine is to weaken, to challenge and pressure Russia. That’s what they’ve been doing with a great deal of effort and that’s going on because the US policy globally has been to attack and to try to isolate and undermine any country that is not a satellite or potential satellite of US global power. It’s to make the world safe for the Fortune 500, it’s to make the word safe for multinational corporations and that’s what the struggle and conflict in Ukraine is all about.And one of the things you do – you demonize the leader of the country that stands there as some kind of bulwark against you. To justify the intervention that they are perpetrating. The US leaders are demonizing Putin. Today in the US there are all sorts of people who have opinions about President Vladimir Putin. They don’t know a thing about him because there is nothing that is printed in our media about the statements, the suggestions, the overtures he has made. None of these things are publicized. It’s very difficult to find out what he is saying, what’s going on with Ukraine and Russia. What we are getting is a characterization that the Russians are aggrandizers and they have growing grasping plans to take over Ukraine. That’s simply not true. I don’t think Putin wants to in any way try to take over Ukraine. It would be too much of a headache and it’s not at all what he’s been doing.But this thing of regime change is something that the US has used in country after country where you undermine the leadership, you bring in people, you give thousands of t-shirts all the same color, you give them banners and flags, food and money and little squads of snipers when that’s something to be done. Then you tell the American people that these people, this group – Noriega in Panama, Allende in Chile, Aristide in Haiti, Putin in Russia – they are hostile toward America and they threaten us. People feel threatened. Once you demonize the leader this gives you license to attack the country, or bomb it - in the case of Russia that would be too dangerous to do, thank God.You have sanctions against the country, make life difficult for them. You say “Russia was aggressive, look at how it grabbed Crimea”. But they didn’t really. Crimea had belonged to Russia for over 240 years or so. It was taken away by a Soviet leader – Nikita Khrushchev who himself was Ukrainian and Crimea was given to Ukraine. When Crimea voted itself back as part of Russia, 93 percent voted in favor of returning to Russia and that’s where they belonged historically and ethnically and linguistically and also because the social programs and benefits would be better for them and they chose that. And the people in Eastern Ukraine are also trying to word off the Nazi incursions that are coming in, and Kiev bullying and the lie. So that’s my perspective of what is going on.  \n                   Servicemen of the US and Lithuanian armies during a joint exercise on mopping up terrorists during the Rapid Trident-2015 multinational drill on the Yavorovo testing grounds. © Stringer / RIA Novosti     \n                RT: NATO boasts that the \"training has been adapted to the requests of Ukrainians.” Why do you think they're putting so much emphasis on the significance of this boot camp?MP: I think what they fear is not a troubled Russia but a successful Russia. They fear any country whether it be China, Russia, Venezuela, Iraq under Saddam Hussein - who was not a hero and somebody to admire, he worked for the CIA. But when Saddam Hussein suddenly showed himself to be independent and wanting a larger part of the oil quota, when he refused to hand over the oil companies to the British and American petroleum companies, when he kept almost the entire economy state-owned and publicly owned, then the Americans started to find him very troublesome. They decided that he was somebody who was a threat to the US. He was not a threat to the US, but he was a threat to US corporate capitalism and that is something they could not tolerate. The Empire only has two types of people on its borders. It has either satellites who are potential enemies -I mean the satellites who are obedient and follow you - or enemies or potential enemies.They fear Russia if it doesn’t cooperate and do what they want and doesn’t vote the way they want in the UN and accept the oil quotas that the US cartels put up. When those things happen, they are not bothered. But that isn’t what they tell the American people, they tell the American people that this man or that leader is hostile toward us, that he is almost like Hitler, he has secret weapons of mass destruction. These fantasy stories don’t go anywhere, they don’t tell anybody anything and that is what we are seeing today. Ukraine is just another little piece of puppetry in that direction. They have troops right on the Russian border in Latvia, Estonia, and Poland. Ukraine is not geopolitically crucial to American national security. If anything the threat is to Russia of course.

The condemnation of Russia was intense. Putin paid a visit to Crimea in May of that year following the ‘annexation’. This triggered a tough response from Washington. “Crimea belongs to Ukraine and we don’t recognize of course the illegal and illegitimate steps by Russia in that regard,” declared US State Department Spokeswoman Jen Psaki.Putin’s visit to Crimea this week - when he took a dive in a mini submarine to explore Byzantine era wreckage off Crimea’s Black Sea coast - was noticeably different. There were jibes about Putin looking like ‘a Bond villain;’ there were jokes about him looking for signs of the ruble; there were also references to the Kursk submarine disaster, which took place fifteen years earlier.Anti-Putin activists claim President Putin keeps doing stunts in submarines so search engines find fewer references to Kursk sub tragedy— Daniel Sandford (@BBCDanielS) August 18, 2015However, Ukraine’s President Poroshenko’s fierce condemnation of the visit - he called it “a challenge to the civilized world” - seemed to fall on deaf ears, as none of the major Western leaders criticized Putin’s trip to the ‘annexed’ peninsula.This lack of outrage was mirrored in the Western MSM coverage.Sky News referred to Putin as “daring.” CNN in its coverage of the event used Sevastopol, Crimea as the locator and not Ukraine (though they did state on their website that Crimea was “Ukrainian territory”). Putin’s visit was described elsewhere as ‘controversial’, but that’s about as far as it went.How much should one read in to all of this? The muted reaction to Putin’s visit is not the only sign that things could be calming down. Crimea has already been visited by a delegation of French MPs from Nicolas Sarkozy‘s Republican Party. Italian Parliamentarians have announced plans to visit. It’s been reported that Polish MPs are mulling a trip to the peninsula, as are MPs from Germany’s progressive Die Linke party.It’s ludicrous to think that they’re all going there just to bring back some cheap cigarettes.“I think that the French parliamentarian’s trip was a right thing to do. Being elected by the people it was their duty to tell and show the official French authorities, politicians and the society as a whole what is really going on in Crimea right now. This is a correct and demonstrative decision,” Die Linke’s Alexander Neu said.The very fact that delegations of Western politicians are going - and planning to go - to Crimea tells us that they don’t think it will cost them domestic popularity - which is revealing in itself. It shows that you can win political points on the Crimea issue in Europe.It’s not just politicos who are making their way to the peninsula, but music stars too. American rock star Joe Lynn Turner, a former vocalist with Rainbow and Deep Purple, arrived in Crimea this week to give a series of concerts.“I know the truth lives here. And I believe right now, this time Russia is going to be the great power that it already has been and that good always overcomes evil,” Turner told reporters.“I was warned I could be banned in Europe [for giving concerts in Crimea]… but I am a rebel, I have always been a rebel and I will always stay a rebel. I do not care what they say.” “I’ve listened to every leader in the world. The only one telling the truth is Putin,” Turner said.Also this week, the Italian tenor Federico Lepre of La Scala, Milan, performed in Yalta in Crimea with Russian singer Natalia Pavlova-Colantoni of the Moscow State Conservatory.The hope of the neocons that a strict Western boycott of Crimea would be observed has clearly not been realized. Even though visiting the province doesn’t necessarily mean endorsement of it being part of Russia - it does show cracks in the ‘hard-line’ approach. Singers, literally and metaphorically, are walking away from the West’s chorus of condemnation.Here’s why it’s happening. For a start, the neocons argument, which goes something like, “Crimea’s annexation by Russia proves that Putin is the new Hitler,” never really gained much traction - certainly not among the general public.Such a position was fatally weakened by the fact that Crimea was part of Russia between 1783 and 1954 (when it was transferred to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic by Khrushchev) and the fact that the majority of people who live there are, er, Russians. You don’t have to be a hardcore Russian nationalist with the Russia flag tattooed on your biceps to acknowledge that Russia does have pretty strong claims to the province.Western journalists who do know a bit of regional history have undermined the neocon cause.Peter Hitchens, a columnist for Britain’s Mail on Sunday newspaper wrote ’A (not so brief) history of Crimea’ that provided some much needed historical background.He also highlighted Western double standards on the Crimean referendum in another piece entitled, ‘Why don’t we want democracy and self-determination for Crimea?’In The Guardian, Seumas Milne, in an article entitled, 'The clash in Crimea is the fruit of Western expansion,' wrote that: “Western denunciations of Russian intervention in Crimea have reached new depths of self-parody.” READ MORE: Kissinger: ‘Breaking Russia has become objective for US’In the Sunday Telegraph, in December 2014, Christopher Booker wrote: “Quite one of the oddest and most frightening stories of the year has been the ludicrous and persistent misrepresentation in the West of the reason for the tragic shambles unfolding over Russia and Ukraine. This has been presented as wholly the fault of the Russian ‘dictator’ Vladimir Putin, compared by Hillary Clinton and the Prince of Wales to Hitler, for his ‘annexing’ of Crimea… it was entirely predictable that Russia and the ethnic Russians of eastern Ukraine would respond as they have done. So, too, was the wish of the vast majority of Crimeans, 82 percent of them Russian speakers, to rejoin the country of which they were part for most of two centuries.”The political context surrounding the return of Crimea to Russia also weakened the Russophobes’ case. Let’s not forget Crimea would still be part of Ukraine today had it not been for the Western-sponsored toppling of a democratically elected government in Kiev in February 2014. Crimea’s referendum was a direct consequence of a ’regime change’ which Western leaders welcomed.That regime change shattered the consensus under which the country had been governed since the end of the Soviet Union, and which reflected the divisions in the country. The basis of that consensus was that democratic election results would be respected, and that the leaders of Ukraine would also make compromises on foreign policy orientation - maintaining friendly relations with both Russia and the West and not going out of their way to antagonize either.The consensus also meant respecting the full language and other rights of Ukraine’s minorities. All that was shattered by what happened in February 2014. Ukraine’s Russian population felt threatened by the ousting of a President and a government they had largely supported - and in particular were concerned over the prominent role that virulently anti-Russian far-right groups played in the so-called ‘democratic’ uprising.READ MORE: US boxer Roy Jones Jr. asks for Russian passport over cup of tea with Putin in Crimea Regardless of whether or not we regard the referendum of March 2014 as legal or illegal, constitutional or unconstitutional, it’s easy to understand why the majority of people of Crimea decided that with neo-Nazis on the rampage and a fiercely anti-Russia administration in power in Kiev, it was time to say ’dosvedanya’ to Ukraine and return to Mother Russia.The case for regarding Crimea’s return to Russia as the most heinous of crimes has also not been helped by the observable fact that those who cried most loudly about how ‘outrageous’ Crimea’s ‘annexation’ was, were also cheerleaders for the illegal invasion of Iraq.Asked which was worse - illegally invading a sovereign state on the basis of whopping big lie (WMDs) in order to grab its resources and extend your regional hegemony - or a province retuning to a country it had been part of for the best part of two centuries after a referendum - then all but the wild-eyed inhabitants of Planet Neocon would say the former. Let’s not forget too that up to one million have lost their lives following the illegal ‘Shock and Awe’ invasion of Iraq - while the ‘heinous annexation’ of Crimea that had the West’s endless war lobby foaming at the mouth, was relatively bloodless - with only one Ukrainian soldier unfortunately killed.Today, three positions on Crimea can be discerned. We can take the line that there the return of the province was entirely legitimate. The referendum was democratic and represented the will of the people. It couldn’t be unconstitutional, because violent toppling of a democratically elected government in Kiev meant that the old Ukrainian constitution was effectively torn up.We can take the neocon line that holding a referendum was an act of aggression on a par with the Nazis attacking Poland/Czechoslovakia/Low Countries, etc and was a sign that ‘Russian imperialism’ threatens the entire world (unlike the ‘benign’ liberal invasions, oops, interventions, against sovereign states that the US and its allies have engaged in over the past 20 years and which have, er.. brought so much peace and stability to the Middle East and beyond).Or we can take a third position, which is the one I’d say reflects where quite a few Western politicians are now, even though they might not openly admit it for fear of being branded ‘Putin appeasers.' This position is: “While we believe Ukraine’s territorial integrity should have been maintained, it’s hardly worth risking world war three over to get a historical province of Russia, populated by Russians to return to Ukraine and we need to try and get things back to normal.”The reality is Crimea is now part of Russia again - and no amount of neocon rage will change this.European businesses - and particularly manufacturing companies - are losing out over the anti-Russian sanctions and would like to see them lifted. There is no real appetite outside of Russophobic circles to push things further. A new Crimean war is highly unlikely.It’s also important to point out that the West - whether it likes it or not - needs Putin’s cooperation on a number of issues, particularly in the Middle East. The nuclear deal with Iran was only achieved with the Kremlin’s help. If Western leaders are serious about defeating ISIS (admittedly a big ‘if’ considering how much Western powers and their regional allies have enabled ISIS), then Russia assistance will be crucial. In the words of that well known left-wing peacenik Henry Kissinger: “For the West the demonization of Putin is not a foreign policy - it’s an alibi for the absence of one.”Crimea remains subject to harsh western sanctions and is likely to be referred to as ‘illegally annexed’ for quite some time yet. In March, the US vowed to maintain sanctions as long as Russia’s ‘occupation’ continued.Nevertheless, the muted reaction to Putin’s visit this week must have made the neocons and those who do want to risk WW3 over Crimea rather concerned that things are gradually changing.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.LISTEN MORE:","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        Putin goes to Crimea – but where’s the Western outrage?\n\n     \n\n    "}

Under Western political microscopes criminality has been defined by geography, political worth and financial solvency – oddities such as international laws carry little weight compared to absolute political pragmatism.Only this week, one of America and Britain's most loyal partners in the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was left shamefaced as UK residents circulated a petition demanding his arrest for war crimes against Gaza during the 2014 summer offensive. Inspired by Damian Moran, the petition has already generated much media coverage due to the implications it carries for the UK government.READ MORE: The messy US ‘strategy’ in Syria Filed on the UK Parliament website, the petition, if signed by 100,000 people, would force government officials to open a public debate. This is clearly something politicians have been keen to avoid in view of Israel's litany of well -documented aggravated human rights violations and war crimes – notwithstanding Britain's own guilt in quietly standing by while thousands of unarmed civilians were marked for murder.\"Benjamin Netanyahu is to hold talks in London this September. Under international law he should be arrested for war crimes upon arrival in the UK for the massacre of over 2,000 civilians in 2014,\" reads the petition.While it is likely that Moran's campaign will be buried and forgotten – or so the Establishment hopes – such efforts on the part of the public to expose western dealings, and hold officials accountable before the judiciary, are a sure sign of the growing dichotomy between the people and their leaders.If the United States could still claim in the wake of World War II to be a power for good, a democratic lighthouse for aspiring modern civil states, its taste for political meddling and covert military dealings have turned this once-promising American idealism into the very despotic force it vowed to always oppose.America's first brush with political imperialism would come in 1953 when then-US President Dwight Eisenhower engineered the overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh because he had the temerity to challenge Britain's monopoly on Iranian oil. While London had been clever enough to play the Cold War card to secure Washington's cooperation, US officials were more than happy to oblige in the undermining of a democracy.READ MORE: 45,000 demand Israel PM Netanyahu’s arrest for ‘war crimes’ during UK state visit As a result of America's intervention, Iran spent the next two decades under the thumb of a tyrant – America's very own friend in Tehran: Mohammad Reza Shah. Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci would write of the Shah: \"He is a highly dangerous megalomaniac because he combines the worst of the old and the worst of the new.\"Interestingly, as Britain’s empire receded into the shadows, America rose to become the leading venture imperialist par excellence. Vladimir Lenin's predictions on the development of capitalism into neo-imperialism were proved absolutely correct.In \"Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism,\" Lenin advances the theory that modern-day imperialism has been fueled by rabid economic ambitions - capitalism, in contrast to other forms of colonialism: i.e. military expansionism.As Phil Gasper explains: \"Lenin's argument was that the rivalries and wars between capitalist powers were inherent in one of capitalism's basic features: the tendency for capital to become more centralized and concentrated – in other words, for the dominant capitalist firms to acquire monopoly or near-monopoly status in particular sectors of their national economy.\"On its way down the moral ladder, and up on Neo-Imperial Avenue, western powers, Washington and London in the lead, have cultivated rather interesting friendships – several, one might venture, irreconcilable with “western values.”Among those favored by the West once figured late Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, late Libyan Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and the former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Those autocrats were of course quickly discarded as political dynamics shifted, opening the door to new friendships: Saudi King Salman, Egyptian President Abd El Sisi… the list goes on.READ MORE: Netanyahu ‘urged European leaders to support’ resolution against Israel In the eyes of the West, political stability takes precedence overall, no matter how violent the regime or criminal the means of repression – capitalism, after all, thrives in a controlled environment.When Saudi King Abdullah died in January this year, US President Obama visited his successor, accompanied by a platoon of state officials, including the CIA director, who took great pains in declaring his undying admiration for the late king and offering his utmost support to the new monarch. The fact that King Salman has sent several dozen men to their deaths since his coronation, mostly for daring to exercise freedom of expression, raised not an eyebrow in Washington.But if America is blind to its allies' “indiscretions,\" such courtesies are not extended to those rogue powers which have had the audacity of remaining independent. Russia, most of all, knows the bite of western hypocrisy.Slammed for denouncing foreign political meddling in Syria, Moscow suffered sanctions for its partaking in the protection of Crimea against the rise of Ukraine’s far-right.

We’ve seen rallies mounting since Russia adopted its EU food embargo last year. How badly is the embargo, which was in response to Western sanctions on Russia, hurting Europe’s economy?Mattias Westman: Well, I think on the overall European economy it has limited impact, but of course some of the more vulnerable groups, in farming communities and also particularly in the south and south-east of Europe are suffering more than others.RT: Key Western leaders have also promoted the extension of sanctions on Russia on numerous occasions. Do you consider sanctions an appropriate way to deal with Moscow?MW: Well, in a recent article I published in a German magazine I tried to sort this question out from a more usefulness point of view. I would say it’s very difficult to see how these sanctions could have any beneficial effect on Russia or on the situation in Ukraine.RT: US President Barack Obama has also been weighing in again on numerous occasions. He said that Western sanctions have clearly damaged the Russian economy. Do you agree with that sentiment?MW: Well, I think it’s not entirely correct. I mean, of course the sanctions have had some negative impact, but the slowdown we’ve seen in Russia in the last year, I think has a lot more to do with the price of commodities; the price of oil has fallen by 50 percent, which inevitably was going to have an effect on the Russian economy, particularly on the ruble. And I think the Central Bank did the right thing in terms of allowing the ruble to fluctuate and to decline with the terms of trade in order to preserve the margins and the competitiveness of the Russian industry.RT: In your article, you said that the Western approach towards Russia over Ukraine was kind of an ‘own goal’ of historic proportions. What do you mean by that?MW: Well, I think that there is a lot of talk in the West about Russia being a threat to the global system or the global security. But I think the real challenge to the global balance of power, as it is, is really China, which is a rapidly rising power. And by taking this aggressive stance against Russia, a confrontational stance I should say, you have the effect of Russia and China cooperating further and that only strengthens this more serious threat to the global dominance of the West – of course, if that is a beneficial thing.RT: You just mentioned China. Amid the sanctions, we saw Russia signing a record trillion dollar deal with the Chinese. Do you think the West is losing a key economic partner?MW: Well, I think this process is to some extent inevitable because the Chinese and Russian economies are very compatible and there are many benefits from trade between the countries, but I think that this try to politicize the relationships, and driving a conflict, is speeding up that process. And I think seeing Russia and China as strategic allies is not really in their interests, but that’s the effect of the policies that they are pursuing.RT: What are your predictions for the future? And in terms of sanctions what needs to actually happen for them to be lifted on both sides?MW: Well, it’s two different things here. The USA is unlikely to lift sanctions anytime soon; it is politically inconvenient to do so – to look weak against Russia and so on. The situation in Europe is quite different. First of all, it requires unanimous decisions to prolong the sanctions when they come up to you again in January, I think. And already in the summer, now, when they were prolonged for six months, there are lot countries who didn’t want to do it. As far as I understand there were about seven hawks who wanted to prolong them, seven doves who wanted to lift them, and the rest were somewhere in the middle. And I think each time it will become harder and harder to bully the countries who want to lift the sanctions. So, of course, the current situation, where things are, after all, calming down a little bit in Ukraine, and you see that the reverse sanctions biting a bit in the south of Europe – I think that increases the likelihood of lifting sanctions. And I also think they (America) probably might not want to spend so much political capital on bullying their countries into agreeing on prolongation very much longer.RT: Just finally, Russia denies being involved in the military conflict in Ukraine, yet it’s being sanctioned for its alleged role in the war, while Kiev does enjoy a lot of support from the West. What are your thoughts on that overall picture?MW: Well, of course, it is a very complex question, but I think is unfortunate that the West has taken such a strong side for one part of an internal conflict in Ukraine. And I think there’s a lack of understanding of what the causes of this conflict are. Hopefully – and I have seen some signs of it – that some more awareness is coming on that this is not as simple as it might have looked from the beginning.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        ‘West’s aggressive stance pushes Russia to China, threatens Western dominance’\n\n     \n\n    "}

I’m unsure whether it was a romantic attachment to the Football Pools or the last remnants of stoic, Protestant values. Anyway, the UK didn’t ‘enjoy’ its first National Lottery draw until 1994.Nobody does light-entertainment TV as well as the Brits and the BBC took to the format with gusto. Soon, a Lancashire lady called Mystic Meg was a household name. Meg’s slot was good fun. The pseudo-psychic would attempt to predict facts about the future winner. Of course, Meg was usually very wrong. Her repeated failures became something of a national institution and the butt of countless jokes.Not being a fan of 14 million to 1 bets, I haven’t followed the Lottery too closely since. Nor Meg’s career. However, I’ve long suspected that the hapless clairvoyant might have inspired a lot of the commentary one reads on Russia in the Western media. Some of the predictions over the years have made Mystic Meg look entirely believable.Hardly a month goes by when somebody isn’t predicting Russia’s imminent demise. The conspiracy theories usually vary. However, regular suspects are the collapse of the government, a Chechen war redux, a demographic implosion or an invasion by China.The daddy of them all came back in 1999 when Anders Aslund predicted ‘Russia’s Collapse’ in a seminal Foreign Affairs article. This groundbreaking piece pioneered the, then innovative, use of complete nonsense to scare the living daylights out of people in the West. It frightened investors, students and anybody who had any intention of discovering Russia at that time.A Swedish Oxford graduate, Aslund had worked as an adviser to Boris Yeltsin’s notoriously incompetent 1990’s administration in Moscow. The ‘shock therapy’ prescribed by Aslund caused untold misery across Russia. Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz described the policy as “a failure.”Nevertheless, in ’99, a year after an economic crash had sidelined Aslund’s protégés at the Kremlin, he twisted the knife. Amazingly, some still take Aslund seriously as a Russia analyst. Earlier this year, he predicted that Russia’s economy would contract by 10 percent in 2015. The World Bank estimates 2.7%. On the basis that a stopped clock is right twice a day, Aslund has been trying to advise Ukraine, through the opinion pages of the Kyiv Post. Ukraine, frankly, has more than enough problems already.Aslund’s continued presence serves as proof that nobody ever went hungry from being continuously wrong on Russia. This surely warms the hearts of editors at the Economist magazine, where Mystic Meg may, or may not, work these days. Due to the fact that its articles aren’t deemed worthy of by-lines, this is unclear.As Business New Europe’s Ben Aris pointed out last year, the Economist has “an institutional hatred” of Russia. “Those who cover and invest in Russia have long ago cancelled their subscriptions to the Economist; in Moscow at least it has a reputation for bias and selective reporting that makes its coverage next to useless,” the experienced Moscow correspondent wrote.Not content with weekly digs at Russia, that extend from the subtle to the crude, the Economist finally ran the full gamut of A to Z last week and hit rock bottom. In an article titled “If Russia Breaks Up,”  they took the biscuit to the extent that the proverbial Cheesecake was denuded. Attempting to conflate the Ukrainian civil war with the 1904-05 Russo-Japanese war, the anonymous Economist author made the magazine look even more silly than usual.\n                   © Ilya Naymushin / Reuters     \n                The Economist’s supposition centered on the ill-informed notion that there exists a groundswell of support for Siberia separatism. Even more ridiculously the magazine alleged that the dominant Far Eastern cities of Vladivostok and Khabarovsk are “more economically integrated with China and South Korea than they are with the European part of Russia.”This is inaccurate on so many levels. In fact, the precise problem with the Russian Far East is that it’s not integrated enough with east Asia and far too reliant on Europe and the rest of Russia for trade. Aside from a few ramshackle ‘Chinese markets’ and the odd Korean restaurant, Khabarovsk is as European as Galway or Lisbon, despite being over 6,000 km from the Ural Mountains. Recognizing the problem, the Kremlin has recently designated sections of the Far East as “special economic zones.” If Moscow feared a breakaway, it would hardly make sense for it to encourage integration between the region and its Asian neighbors.The Economist is not alone in the sudden, rather bonkers, obsession with the notion that the Russian state might disintegrate through Siberian separatism. Of course, it hardly needs mentioning that the periodicals own home nation, the UK, is much more likely to combust as Scottish nationalists become increasingly dominant in Edinburgh and Ulster's demographics point to a United Ireland before long.In the past month, both Quartz and the Wilson Quarterly have been beating the same drum. The former, headquartered at Washington’s iconic Watergate, is owned by Atlantic Media, which specializes in government-targeted publications. Meanwhile, the latter is controlled by the US capital’s Wilson Centre. Incidentally, Aslund has been associated with the institution.The Wilson Quarterly’s Elizabeth Peet, a newcomer to Russia-focused journalism, based her entire argument on a Eurozine report by Stanislav Zakharkin. In turn, Zakharkin seems to have been inspired by a 2011 rally in Novosibirsk, titled ‘Stop Feeding Moscow.’ According to local sources, the protest was attended by the grand total of 100 people. Straws. At. Clutching. That was 100 folk in a city of 1.5 million souls. I’ve seen longer bus queues in Russia.Not to be outdone, Quartz went for the jugular. Written by one Bradley Jardine, the article asked, “Could surging Siberian nationalism break up Russia?” When I stopped laughing, I realized that the author had interned at the US propaganda outlet, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The same RFE/RL that fired a Russian journalist last year for attempting to tell the truth about Ukrainian war atrocities. Perhaps, if Andrey Babitsky was still employed, he could have advised Bradley Jardine on the ridiculousness of his argument.Jardine hilariously invokes ‘tensions’ and ‘hostility’ between Moscow and Siberia. He describes the 100-person march in Novosibirsk as a “major rally.”Now for the reality: there is more chance of Texas separating from the USA than Siberia suddenly shunting away from Russia. For starters, historic Siberia is 77 percent of Russia’s total land area. The Siberian Federal District is 30 percent. Hence, even in the very unlikely event of Russian collapse, it would be the rest of the country separating from it.\n                   © Ilya Naymushin / Reuters     \n                There’s also the fact that Siberia \u0026 the Russian Far East are more uniformly Slavic (95 percent) and Orthodox Christian than most ‘European’ Russian regions. This includes Moscow, which allegedly has a 91-percent ethnic Russian population, but that doesn’t account for the vagaries of Russia’s registration system. Furthermore, Asian Russians are generally more integrated than Caucasus Muslims, for instance.This is not to say that Siberia’s demographic make-up is the sole reason for its continued loyalty to Russia. Aside from cultural ties, Siberia needs the protection of the Russian state. Alone, its more densely populated Asian neighbors would overwhelm it.However, natives never discuss such concerns. For one simple reason - Siberia is as Russian as Balalaikas and Seld Pod Shuboi (a famous herring-based salad). There’s no desire in Novosibirsk to exit the Russian Federation and most locals would guffaw at the suggestion.There’s also no danger of Yorkshire departing from the UK, Provence leaving France or Colorado separating from the USA. Quite correctly, the Economist, Quartz and the Wilson Quarterly don’t even entertain such crazy notions. Why then do they ignore reason when it comes to Russia?The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        As real as the Yeti - Western propaganda tries to invent Siberian Nationalism\n\n     \n\n    "}

According to unnamed sources, the hacker attack occurred on July 25 and did not touch any classified information. Still the US officials can’t provide any evidence of that.RT: So the US military is again blaming Russia for hacking its servers without providing actual proof. What's your take on that?Caleb Maupin: This is just another example of the Western media creating a narrative. This is just a constant theme in the US press that somehow Russia is aggressive, that Russia is threatening the US. It is a constant theme but it’s false. In fact it is the US that is escalating tensions with Russia. US troops and US military hardware are pouring into Eastern Europe; the US overthrew the democratically-elected government of Ukraine and replaced it with a virulently anti-Russian government. The US continues to fund anti-government forces in Syria, which is a country allied with Russia. So it is the US that is attacking Russia, and yet we get a barrage of media stories trying to make it as if it is the other way around and it is very disturbing. No evidence has been presented, and it really makes no sense: why would Russia be motivated to hack the computers of the US?RT: The UK has also accused Russia of hacking into Snowden Files putting MI6 agents under threat. Back then there was no sufficient answer to the question of why Moscow was blamed.CM: Yes, why would any country seek a war with the US? The US has the biggest military budget of any country in the world; it plays a central role in the economy. Countries around the world do not want a confrontation with the US. It is the US that repeatedly forces the confrontation on any country that asserts its independence, whether that country is Iran, Venezuela, Cuba, China, or Russia. No matter what, if a country asserts their independence that is when the US enters a confrontation with them.The reality is that the US is engaging in cyber terrorism around the world, and that has been made blatantly apparent. Chinese computers and Chinese government computers frequently are hacked by the US. And Edward Snowden revealed that the US has a vast apparatus of cyber warfare that it has been engaging in around the world, but we never hear anything about that. But then these unsubstantiated claims against Russia, against China, show up in the media and it is supposed to justify further hostility and confrontation, when it is the US who is the source of aggression in all of these international situations.\n                   © Pawel Kopczynski  / Reuters     \n                RT: You mentioned that it was revealed by Edward Snowden that the NSA and GCHQ had hacked the Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab. How does that sit with US accusations of hacking by Russia?CM: Yes, even the most compliant US allies - like Germany and Poland - have been subjected to spying from the US with the cellphone calls and all kinds of private e-mails being recorded by the US. US leaders are really out of control: spying on people around the world, cyber hacking people around the world. But then every so often a story comes up and we are supposed to hate Russia here in the US, because Pentagon officials tell us that something has been hacked. Well, I don’t trust the government in the US. And most people here in the US don’t trust their government. If you look at the polls, people don’t believe this - they know that the big oil companies, the owners of natural gas corporations here in the US, as the prices go down, they want to drive Russia out of international markets. They don’t like having a competitor like Russia exporting oil and natural gas, and they are creating an international confrontation which is very dangerous.I think people in the US want peace with Russia and with every other country in the world. I think that is what people in Russia want as well. Wall Street and the Pentagon are really forcing an international confrontation on the world that people of the world don’t want.

In Crimea, the majority converse in Russian and their hearts have always beaten patriotically for the motherland. Crimea, after all, was part of Russia from 1784 until 1954, at which juncture Nikita Khrushchev, a native of Ukraine incidentally, made what some consider a major blunder: the Soviet leader gift-wrapped the peninsula and handed it over to the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.Crimea is now part of Russia again, a fact that has vexed the West no end. The Western media vilifies President Putin for this affront and the neocons in Washington want his head on a platter. They drone on about a land-grab and the abrogation of international law. However, the Crimeans held a referendum and in a massive 80-percent turnout at the polls, some 96 percent voted to secede and rush back into the arms of Mother Russia, with the wolves of Kiev and their Western masters baying for blood at their heels. Instead, like a murder of crows, the pack descended on eastern Ukraine and picked it to pieces. I don't think Moscow could have rigged what was virtually a unanimous vote in Crimea, and in my view to call it a Kremlin heist is a gross distortion of the facts.Cool-hand Putin of course encouraged it all. He says his motive was to avoid the carnage and bloodshed that has tragically unfolded in eastern Ukraine. A French delegation of MPs, much to the chagrin of French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, visited the Crimea in late July to see for themselves how things are going on there. They were delighted to find that life is fine in the peninsula. “Crimea is an absolutely peaceful region,” said one of the French MPs on the fact-finding mission, Claude Goasguen. He went on to say, rather encouragingly from a Western politician: “A parliamentarian in a democratic country and a democrat sees a major obligation in fighting misinformation, especially at the state level.”On the other hand, the population in the Donbass and Lugansk regions of eastern Ukraine has suffered terribly at the hands of their own people. The civil war has taken a devastating toll in human life, caused massive infrastructural damage and left the country at the mercy of internal thuggery and corruption. Ukraine’s humanitarian crisis has reached epic proportions. There are now over a million displaced persons in Ukraine, and something approaching a million more frightened and desperate Ukrainians have fled to Russia. This puts the Russian Federation top of the current world list for asylum applications. Nobody in the West appears to bat an eyelid about this refugee crisis, preferring to persist in their favorite sport of Russia-bashing.It might occur to a casual bystander that the best solution would be to simply partition the country into an East and West Ukraine and have done with it. However, the thing to bear in mind about Ukraine is that all the country’s wealth, its heavy industry, coalmines etc, is concentrated in the East. So naturally Kiev will fight like a rat in a corner and slaughter its own people to keep their mitts on the country’s ‘crown jewels’. But the redoubtable folk in its eastern regions are hard as nails and are unlikely to capitulate.\n                   Members of the far-right radical group Right Sector and their supporters attend an anti-government rally in Kiev, Ukraine, July 21, 2015. © Gleb Garanich / Reuters     \n                Ukraine is a disaster, a bankrupt nation run by crooks and hoodlums, in hock to another set of villains in the EU. It's little reported in the West, but now there are major ructions in the West of the country. The problem is Right Sector, which is basically a private army of Nazis who wield crippling power, attended by gangsterism, racketeering and violence. It was they who were in the vanguard of ousting Yanukovich in 2014 (a legally elected president), and now Right Sector is pushing to eject the current band of knaves and cutthroats holding court in Kiev. It’s a real comedy of errors, except there is nothing much to laugh about. Any country that has a private army rampaging about is in for big trouble. If you lie down with dogs, you wake up with fleas, as the saying goes. Poroshenko and his ilk could well find themselves dragged out into the streets and shot without so much as a by your leave. Mr Poroshenko, an oligarch with a somewhat dubious and shady past, had better have his private jet standing by for a quick getaway.However, it might then be shot down and doubtless the blame would be laid on another ‘Putin’s missile’ (headline courtesy of that bastion of balanced journalism – the Sun). In case you were unaware, according to the Sun it was ‘Putin’s missile’ that shot down flight MH17 last July over Ukraine!The West has encouraged and in fact orchestrated the mayhem and madness in Ukraine. Millions of dollars were pumped in to fund NGOs, whose ulterior motive was to bring about regime change and create chaos on Russia’s borders. And for their henchman they selected or at least condoned Nazi thugs such as Right Sector to do the dirty work. I find it ironic and sad in the extreme that our fathers and grandfathers fought a long and bitter WWII to rid the world of Nazism (helped out a great deal by Russia who lost something like 25 million souls in the effort), while today the West is turning a blind eye to its menace in Ukraine. And all in a sick and twisted geopolitical game.The good news is that NATO has blown Mission Ukraine. Despite all the sanctions and hoo-ha, it’s hard to lend credence to the assertion that Russia is a threat and has designs on sweeping west to cut a red swathe through the heartlands of Europe. Nobody is really buying that particular brand of baloney. ‘The Russians are coming’ was always a rather empty and silly jest, anyway. On the other hand, NATO has swept east, despite the promise of Bush Sr to the Russians in the early 90s that they wouldn't. For heaven’s sake, Russia is the biggest country in the world; it doesn't need to go rampaging about like a bear in a glass factory.The Baltic States and their pathetic whining about the ‘Russian threat’ are frankly a laughing stock. NATO generals and Western politicians maunder on about this ad nauseam too, but anyone with half a brain should be able to shred this tissue of lies into fragments and see it for what it is: a desperate and ill-judged move to demonize and ultimately unseat Putin in the old game of let’s change the regime. Judging by opinion polls in Russia, the plan has backfired spectacularly. An overwhelming majority of the population approves of Vladimir Putin, and the chances of ousting him appear about as likely as installing a Communist Commander-in-Chief in the White House. Incidentally, China’s leader, Xi Jinping, enjoys similar popularity at home.The Ukraine game is just one move in the grand geopolitical game of chess. The US is in check now, and checkmate could be just round the corner. I believe America has gone too far this time. Of course, no one can match the US for military power, but Moscow and Beijing have been bending like reeds in the wind, or in boxing parlance they have been biding their time, soaking up the punishment on the ropes. Are they getting ready to deliver a knockout blow?If you study the financial markets you can see strange things afoot. China dumped half a trillion dollars and Russia’s dollar reserves are the lowest since the 1980s. Other countries such as Japan are also frantically ditching dollars. Switzerland has unpegged the Swiss franc from the euro; these and other intriguing signs suggest something is in the works. Some financial analysts are predicting that the Russia, BRICS, China axis is getting ready to wreak financial Armageddon on America. They are simply a tad cannier than the bullyboys in Washington. Putin is one hard, cool player and the Chinese... Well, you don't want to mess with them. Uncle Sam is, of course, far from being an idiot and Jade Helm (a little military exercise encompassing seven states and gargantuan amounts of firepower) looks like a prelude to martial law when the whole house of cards comes tumbling down.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.Steve Elliott, for RT","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        What next after the neocon rape of Ukraine?\n\n     \n\n    "}

The evidence includes testimony of eyewitnesses and participants of these events, photos and various materials presented by international organizations.The document also reads that the agency continues the investigation into the suspected crimes committed on the territory of the neighboring state and that a special department has been created within the Investigative Committee for this purpose.Bastrykin wrote that the ultimate goal of the project was to ensure that all those involved in crimes receive the just punishment.The name of the law enforcers’ report is apparently made similar to the document earlier released by the Russian Foreign Ministry.

The blacklist has been expanded to include new individuals and companies.READ MORE: US imposes further sanctions on Russia over Crimea, east Ukraine conflict RT: Mark Toner, State Department spokesperson, has said that these are not new sanctions, but strengthening of the existing sanctions. What do you make of that? Is that common practice?Gregory Copley: Not really is it such common practice. They are using the existing legislation and practice to strengthen the sanctions regime. It’s no coincidence, however, as to the timing. The US worked very hard to get Russia aboard the P5+1 talks and an agreement with Iran. Now that that accord is in place with Iran, the US has begun to move to circumvent Iran and Iran’s allies. They have now moved to work with Turkey for example on getting Turkey back into the military operations against Syria, and to upgrade US operations against Syria. They are moving to, in other words, to constrain Iran by those actions and Iran’s allies and in this case it’s Russia.So the US has introduced these sanctions or these additional sanctions literally as a follow-on to the post-Iran agreement, so they can now get back into the game of competing with Russia, competing with Iran. The State Department got what it wanted and President Obama got what he wanted by getting an agreement with Iran which is great for him domestically. But now he is moving back to support his old allies – Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the like – and to literally try and circumvent any Russian gains in the area.RT: These new sanctions come on the heels of yesterday's UN vote on a tribunal for MH17. The American embassy in Russia says these issues are not linked. Then why did they mention it?GC: I think the US expected Russia to veto that proposal so it was very much part of the process of renewed confrontation between Moscow and Washington or Washington and Moscow. Of course there is no suggestion that the US itself has to refrain from interference in Ukraine. The US has continued to escalate its provision of weapons to the western Ukraine government and has been providing a lot of agitation there leading up to the original Russian actions in Crimea for example.RT: Have sanctions proved effective so far? Are they having a desired effect on Russia?GC: There is no question that it’s not helping the Russian economy. The Western media is quick to point out that the Russian economy grew only by 1.5 percent until recently and a flat couple of quarters since then, so clearly something is happening. But the same could be said for the US economy which is flat negative at this stage. The reality is that the sanctions are not helping anybody, quite the contrary they are also reinforcing the growing rift between the US and the EU; this is going to have a profound effect negatively both on the EU and the US in the near future. We see that the US and some European states are trying to strengthen or reposition NATO once again to give it a mission, and Ukraine is part of the perceived threat which has done that. But the reality is that NATO is split, Europe and the US are split, and this is only going to get worse the more that the US uses sanctions against Russia, which will have a very deleterious effect particularly on the European states.\n                   U.S. President Barack Obama © Jonathan Ernst / Reuters     \n                RT: US Marines have recently arrived in Ukraine for military drills. Is this going to create more tension?GC: Of course it adds to tensions, it’s designed to do so. It’s designed to give President Obama the appearance that he is taking strong action and that he is a strong leader. In fact, the purpose and impact of these military deployments and the military aid to western Ukraine does not further US and Western strategic interests at this stage.During the Cold War, the big goal was to drive a rift between the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China. That worked very successfully with Stalin and Nixon’s visit to China and the gradual rift which we saw between the PRC and the Soviet Union. What the current US actions have done in Ukraine has been effectively to drive the Russian Federation back into the arms of People’s Republic of China, creating a strategic block and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), which is not necessarily helpful to the West at all.Sanctions ‘astonishingly impotent’ as foreign policy toolPatrick James, professor of International Relations at the University of Southern California, suggests that sanctions don’t work in terms of affecting policy changes, as those who suffer from them are basically ordinary people and not those in insular elite positions in society.RT: The State Department says this is just a strengthening of the old sanctions, not the imposition of new ones. What's the difference?Patrick James: The difference that anyone outside of an expert could detect would be very minimal. What they are saying in the papers, and of course it is being reported very differently in various places, is that it is a continuation of policy. They are claiming it’s not timed in any particular way as retaliation, but that isn’t taken very seriously. My own view is someone who has studied sanctions extensively and even published research on it is that they are generally a tempest in a teapot. The attempts to coerce against Russia will have absolutely no impact whatsoever.READ MORE: West looks to close loopholes in anti-Russian sanctions – mediaThe reason it may be independently timed is that the President is not very well received right now across the board for the Iranian deal, and is in need for domestic political reasons for something that is a get-tough kind of movement. To be candid, since Russia is generally unpopular among Americans for the most part, it’s a convenient type of target. I don’t have any proof that what I’m saying is correct, but it would fit the bill, namely that the President is being accused perhaps of being too accommodating toward Iran, which is seen as a Russian client, and now can look, if you will, like he is a tough guy coming after the Russian sponsors of Iran with these new sanctions.RT: The American embassy in Russia says the new restrictions are not linked to Wednesday's vote at the UN Security Council when Moscow vetoed the creation of an MH17 tribunal. Do you agree?PJ: It’s so coincidental that occasionally these things can be that or, at the same time, it’s linked. Now if I had to bet everything that I had on which way it goes, it is not a coincidence and it is linked, but it also could be independently explained by domestic political problems and perhaps the president thought he could get a two-for-one; that is, he could retaliate for what happened quite recently in a Russian context, but also gets some mileage out of counteracting the weak- willed image that he is accused of having at this point on the international stage because of the accommodations toward Iran. In other words, it could really be both things at once and it’s hard to imagine there is no connection at all.RT: Have sanctions proved effective so far?PJ: Absolutely not. Sanctions - and much academic research on this subject bears out what I’m about to say - are astonishingly impotent. They do not have the impact that is intended a lot of the time regrettably those who suffer from sanctions are people in society in weak positions, they do not affect or change the view of people in insular elite positions in society, and therefore they tend to have no impact or, even worse, they actually damage survivability, quality of life whatever you want to call it, of people in vulnerable positions while getting absolutely no policy changes that are desired. I could cite many historical cases. Perhaps an interesting and amusing coincidence has been an attempt since approximately 1960s, soon after Fidel Castro had taken power, to engage in sanction of Cuba, which had absolutely no effect on Cuba whatsoever because it could find so many other places ultimately to sell its goods. First, the Soviet Union served as a protector; later on other states would be willing to trade with it. Sanctions don’t work in terms of affecting policy changes.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.LISTEN MORE:","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        US sanctions against Russia will have ‘deleterious effect on EU states’\n\n     \n\n    "}

And strengthening of Russia’s defense potential, including the budgetary decisions passed by the State Duma is done only for one purpose, which is to prevent the war,” Naryshkin stated in a major interview with Izvestia daily, published on Thursday in connection with the anniversary of Russia’s joining WWI on Serbia’s side.At the same time, the Duma chief promised that Russia would always defend the interests of its allies and “close people,” but not by military means. “We will do this through pressing for strict observation of the international law by others, not by violating it. We want peoples to decide their own destiny on their own land,” he said.READ MORE: ‘Budget optimization will not affect Russian defense order’ - PutinExceptionalism as neo-colonial ideologyThe top Russian MP also blasted the attempts to revive the neo-colonial policy in the modern world saying that it has appeared due to the weak reaction to crimes against peace and humanity and due to toleration of fascist and racist ideologies.“Many military conflicts started with the silent connivance to the ideas of one people’s superiority over others. In this sense the modern ideologies of exceptionalism are extremely dangerous,” Naryshkin stated.He explained that the modern limitations imposed on the sovereignty on NATO and EU countries could be perceived as colonial policy and the deal suggested by European Union to Ukraine – to bear obligations without having any rights – can only be described as a colonial status.Naryshkin also told the newspaper that Russia has a lot of allies, even in countries where governments were populated by open Russophobes.“We know that real public sentiments are different there, if all EU countries had the opportunity do make independent decisions on anti-Russian sanctions we would see a very different picture,” he said.He added that the United States gained a lot of benefits from the current conflict in Europe not because of “mythical” isolation of Russia, but rather due to the fact that EU nations get weaker and lose their international reputation.READ MORE: Europe should overcome US pressure, resume cooperation with Russia - Duma chiefNo reversal on Crimea ascensionIn the same interview the speaker completely ruled out the possibility of change in Russia’s position over Crimea.“The self-determination of Crimea is the will of the people of Crimea and Sevastopol that has been supported by all the Russian people. How can we reverse this? Maybe our Western opponents compare Russia to themselves and for them there is little meaning in the will of the people, their opinions and historical memory.”Earlier this year Naryshkin already expressed the opinion that European nations should stop following the plans imposed on the by the United States and start executing own plans for their own benefits. He also positively assessed the idea of a future merger between the Russian Federation and the European Union, proposed by Czech President Milos Zeman.“Zeman didn’t exclude the possibility of EU nations joining the Russian Federation. Our country has repeatedly admitted the possibility of a merger between two regional unions – the Eurasian Economic Union and European Union,” Naryshkin stated. He added that in his view the plan wasn’t a fantasy because Russia “has always been and will always remain in the common family of European people.”READ MORE: Duma chief urges talks on Russia-EU union","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        ‘Third World War would be last for humanity’ – Duma speaker\n\n     \n\n    "}

But you must admit that if we have to discuss inter-European affairs with European partners in Washington, this is not very interesting.”He also mentioned that the US has been “pursuing an imperial policy for a long time.” In addition, he cited the opinion of some American political analysts who “believe that this imperial angle hurts the US.”Putin explained that Russia’s stance on US foreign policy “has nothing to do with anti-Americanism,” adding that Russians “have respect and great love for the USA, and especially for the American people.”Europe fighting terrorism: ‘Better late than never’When answering a question about Russia’s earlier efforts to fight terrorism and the lack of Western support at the time, Putin said that European governments had ignored abundant evidence of terrorist activity, such as Al-Qaeda affiliates fighting in the Russian North Caucasus.“When I asked my colleagues, including Europeans: ‘You see what is happening?’ they used to respond: ‘Yes, we do, but due to various domestic, international circumstances, we cannot support you.’ I would tell them then: ‘If you cannot support us – at least don’t hinder our efforts.’”Putin, however, noted that the situation has substantially changed. “Europe and the United States have realized the real dangers of extreme manifestations of radicalism and joined in the fight.

He described it as a “tectonic shift in Europeans’ public conscience” in the direction of protecting national interests, including from foreign political interventions.According to Putin, a number of issues Europe is facing now, including the influx of migrants from places such as war-torn Libya, have to do with “decisions taken over the [Atlantic] ocean.” In fact, Europe is now paying for decisions it did not make, he stressed.\n                   Russian President Vladimir Putin (R) shakes hands with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras © Alexander Zemlianichenko / Reuters     \n                ‘Are UK, US failed FIFA bids behind corruption scandal?’After several questions from Swiss media on the FIFA corruption scandal, Putin said he doesn’t believe it had anything to do with actions of the organization’s head, President Sepp Blatter, hinting that he views the allegations as politically motivated.“We all know the situation developing around Mr. Blatter right now. I don’t want to go into details but I don’t believe a word about him being involved in corruption personally,” Putin stressed.The statement comes days after Blatter pledged FIFA’s “full support” of Russia in hosting the 2018 World Cup at the opening ceremony of the preliminary draw in St. Petersburg.\n                   FIFA's President Sepp Blatter shakes hands with Russia's President Vladimir Putin (R) © Stringer / Reuters     \n                READ MORE: FIFA passes resolution assuring ‘full support’ of 2018 World Cup in Russia - Blatter Blatter announced his resignation in June amidst a bribery scandal pursued by US, Swiss and other authorities.

The scandal coincided with preparations for FIFA World Cups in Russia and Qatar, which are to be held in 2018 and 2022 respectively.Putin questioned whether the efforts to pursue the investigation stemmed from failed attempts of the US and its key ally, the UK, to secure bids to host the 2022 and 2018 World Cups: “The way this fight against corruption looks makes me wonder if it isn’t a continuation of the bids for 2018 and 2022.”“If someone is suspected for committing a crime, then evidence is collected and transferred to a prosecutor of the country the alleged person resides in. But this is in no way connected to one country – big or small – going around the world, dragging to jail individuals that it wants.”Putin praised “people like Mr. Blatter” – the heads of big international sporting federations or those organizing the Olympic Games –for actually bringing nations from around the world closer together and improving the ways they interact. “If there is anyone who deserves the Nobel Prize, it’s those people,” he stressed.","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        Putin: ‘Europe should be more independent, defend own interests’\n\n     \n\n    "}

No one has changed, primarily the government in Kiev; they have not changed their strategic aim nor have their sponsors. They want control over all of Ukraine and they get concessions where they have to, but fundamentally there is no goodwill to really come to a comprehensive agreement that will be agreed upon among all the parties. We just have this example of this latest constitutional amendment that’s supposed to be going up before the Supreme Court in Ukraine: the representatives of Lugansk and Donetsk Republics were not included in this commission.

Is this connected, these two events?AP: Absolutely it is, it is all connected. You just have this carrot and stick, you have these alternative strategies and it’s nice to also have forces that are supposedly not under the control of Kiev - the so-called radical forces like Right Sector, etc. formally not under control of Kiev in fact they publicly renounce Kiev. But then they do some shelling or they do something against the other side, and Kiev has deniability and that’s just a recipe for more war. That reminds me very much of the situation in ex-Yugoslavia twenty years ago. We just had dozens of truces being achieved and yet they were just being used to buy time to rearm, to reorganize and just get ready for the next round of war. What we really need is a firm decision on the part of Kiev’s sponsors to say: “Ok, this is enough; we want a Ukraine that will be acceptable to both neighbors to the East and to the West; until that happens we will just have more war and tactical truces.”\n                   Members of the far-right radical group Right Sector. © Valentyn Ogirenko / Reuters     \n                RT: Earlier this month, anti-government forces withdrew all their forces from the main conflict zone in the Donetsk region - the village of Shirokino. But some pro-government paramilitaries refuse to leave the area if Kiev says it's withdrawing, isn't there always the risk of paramilitaries staying behind? What part can they play in destabilizing the whole process?AP: They can play a very large part and who is to say that this is not something that was agreed upon behind closed doors out of the public scene by Kiev and the so-called radical forces. It’s just a good cop and a bad cop set-up, it very well could be. Let’s take this thing seriously. Kiev has enough political clout, enough international support, enough arm power that if they wanted to squelch these extremist, radical forces they could. The fact that they haven’t means that they really don’t really have the will to do so and that’s the main problem. Once again, intentions are not open, transparent and honest enough. That’s the whole point. If Kiev wanted to control the Right Sector, they would.RT: Why doesn’t Kiev want to control these groups then?AP: It’s very convenient to have forces that you supposedly don’t control. They could potentially be forces that you are not really controlling, but they also could give you just deniability saying “Oh, they are out of our control, what they do we are not responsible for.” And yet they are doing exactly what is benefitting [to Kiev]. So if Kiev wants somebody to break the truce, to violate a peace agreement, Kiev can remain blameless if you can blame things on radicals that are not under its control. Like I said, it’s a classical good cop – bad cop approach, but it’s probably being coordinated at the very top because these radical forces are relatively small compared to what Kiev has at its disposal regarding military, security forces and international support.LISTEN MORE:The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        Right Sector:  Kiev playing good cop-bad cop against Ukrainian rebels\n\n     \n\n    "}

There is no excuses for the other side to break the [Minsk] agreement.”During her two-day visit to Kiev, Nuland also pointed out that several of Ukraine’s economic reforms, passed to comply with International Monetary Fund (IMF) standards, move the country closer to getting financial assistance in the sum of $5 billion (€4.6 billion).Granting autonomous status to Donetsk and Lugansk regions was suggested in a truce agreement signed by Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, Russian President Vladimir Putin, as well as German and French leaders in February in the Belarusian capital. The Minsk talks, which were overseen by the OSCE, effectively led to a new ceasefire after the previous truce collapsed. The package of measures, largely based on the earlier September 2014 Minsk Protocol, is meant to resolve the conflict that broke out last April in eastern Ukrainian, leading to the deaths of over 6,500 people, according to UN estimates.READ MORE: Ukraine: Self-proclaimed Donbass republics call for UN war crimes probe Meanwhile, the Ukrainian government continued to insist on its own definition of “decentralization” for Donbass. The word was eventually included in the treaty in reference to granting some degree of autonomy to the regions in eastern Ukraine, although it was never clearly defined there. Poroshenko has contrasted it to the term “federalization” that the Russian side had initially proposed.“There is no hint on a federalization. Ukraine was, is and will be a unitary state. The project envisages no changes and can’t allow any special status for Donbass, there is just no place for it,” Poroshenko said on Thursday, as cited by RIA Novosti.According to Poroshenko, “the project only concedes the possibility of specific local administration in selected territorial entities of Lugansk and Donetsk regions, which is determined by another law.”The current constitutional amendments are regarded as insufficient by the self-proclaimed people’s republics in the industrial east, which originally demanded wider federalization for the country.“Kiev authorities are talking a lot about the reforms, but they are absolutely ignoring the suggestions concerning all the questions of political reforms that are introduced by representatives of Donetsk and Lugansk. That is the most crucial drawback of what they are doing,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said.","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        Ukraine passes ‘historic’ constitutional changes to comply with Minsk agreements – Nuland\n\n     \n\n    "}

Like a Sam’s Choice Joe Goebbels, he\n  relentlessly beats a pro-Kiev drum while pasting a country he has\n  hardly ever been to and knows little about.\nBuzzfeed devotes huge resources to covering\n  Ukraine. Hence, I was hopeful they’d have the inside track. Their\n  only recent reference to Mukachevo appears to be a description of\n  how its monasteries look like palaces. Meanwhile, Buzzfeed’s\n  Kiev correspondent has this month published six stories\n  concerning Russia and nothing about Ukraine at all. This would be\n  the equivalent of covering the United Kingdom from Dublin.\n\n  Across established media, mention of the Mukachevo incident has\n  been muted. The New York Times buried it on page A9, for\n  instance. However, they did at least cover it. So too the Daily Telegraph of London, where Roland\n  Oliphant broke ranks with fellow hack-packers to pen a very good\n  summary. Even the Kyiv Post, hardly known for opposing right-wing\n  extremists in Ukraine, didn’t run away from the story.\n\n  The real story\n\n  For the benefit of those who rely on American media for their\n  news, this is what happened in Mukachevo. On Saturday last, the\n  fascist Right Sector (‘Pravy Sektor’) group, which played a\n  significant role in the Euromaidan coup last year, engaged in a\n  shoot-out with Ukrainian police. According to Anton Gerashchenko,\n  an adviser to Kiev’s Interior Ministry, there were around 20\n  militia men, armed to the teeth, involved in the exchange.\n\n  The neo-Nazi organization claims that a local politician,\n  Mykhaylo Lanyo, ordered police to open fire on their members.\n  Right Sector further alleges that the ‘volunteers’ were merely\n  attending a meeting when they were set upon by blood-thirsty\n  cops. It is accepted that the fascists fired rocket-propelled\n  grenade launchers and Kalashnikov automatic rifles. Now, whatever\n  one may think of Ukraine’s police, they are not noted for taking\n  a principled stand against hoodlums which have serious firepower\n  to hand. Additionally, if Right Sector were really interested in\n  curtailing smuggling, why would they hold secret meetings with\n  local mafia leaders?\n\n  Mustafa Nayyem, a Ukrainian MP and former journalist wrote on\n  his Facebook page that the real reason for the\n  violence was a dispute over the redistribution of the cigarette\n  smuggling business. Nayyem was in Mukacheve last week. The\n  Afghan-born Rada member’s account seems the most plausible.\n\n  Let’s be clear here. Lanyo is a gangster, like most regional\n  governors in Ukraine. The Right Sector is also a bunch of\n  gangsters, masquerading as patriots. Meanwhile, the government in\n  Kiev is also, predominantly, a skulk of thieves. All Maidan\n  achieved was to replace one cabal of crooks with another. This is\n  the reality and no amount of Western media whitewashing can alter\n  this fact.\n\n  When the Right Sector was doing NATO’s bidding in helping to\n  overthrow the elected, albeit horrible, Yanukovich government in\n  Kiev, their extremism was ignored by the EU and US press. Now the\n  same outlets are probably too embarrassed to expose the group's\n  modus operandi.\n\n  For example, on Monday night, the organization’s former Rada\n  candidate, Oleh Kutserib, attended a rally in Kiev, in support of\n  his fellow Nazis. On the way home, he beat up two gay men and\n  then bragged about it on Facebook. I am indebted to the\n  courageous Ukrainian journalist Maxim Eristavi for highlighting\n  this and linking to the offending post. Eristavi, a co-founder of\n  the US embassy-funded Hromadske TV, has been one of the few\n  Maidan cheerleaders honest enough to admit the true colors of\n  some of its protagonists.\n\n  No smoke without fire\n\n  Reaction in Kiev government circles to the Mukachevo shoot-out\n  has been mixed. Of course, these extremists that overthrew\n  Yanukovich and current President Petro Poroshenko know only too\n  well that they could repeat the trick and topple his regime.\n  Naturally a government which relies on private militias to\n  perform army duties is completely impotent when faced with the\n  gang threat. This brings to mind the old dictum, “lie down\n  with the dogs and wake up with the fleas.”\n  Anyway, there is little doubt the weekend’s events were somehow\n  related to contraband. The south-west Ukrainian region of\n  Zakarpattia is renowned for being a hot bed of smuggling\n  activity, which is the lifeblood of western Ukraine. Anybody who\n  has ever crossed the Ukrainian/EU frontier at Chop (Hungary) or\n  Medyka (Poland) can attest to this.\n\n  At the Polish border town of Medyka the practice looks,\n  outwardly, more sad than sinister. All day, lines upon lines of\n  Ukrainians wait to enter Poland, ferrying cigarettes and vodka.\n  It’s reportedly a lucrative business: a legal pack of cigarettes\n  in Ukraine costs €0.94, compared to around €7 in France, where\n  many of the smuggled ‘cancer-sticks’ end up. On the\n  return trip, Medyka’s smugglers bring meat which is, somewhat\n  bizarrely, cheaper in Poland than Ukraine. Border guards on both\n  sides either turn a blind eye or are, more likely, paid to do so.\n  Occasionally the Polish make a few ‘raids,’ one presumes\n  to satisfy some kind of EU quota.\n\n  At Chop, in the same region as the weekend’s ISIS-style gun\n  fight, it’s a lot more aggressive. One noted local scam is\n  related to car license plates. While your car is\n  ‘checked,’ local customs remove the plates and insist\n  you go to the local police station to get them back. Once there,\n  it costs €50 to release them. In 2010, the room contained\n  hundreds of them, mostly Slovakian and Hungarian.\n\n  I personally encountered the reality of Ukrainian corruption in\n  Chop, back in 2011. Upon arriving from Lviv, I had a one-hour\n  wait for a train to make the five minute passage to the next\n  Hungarian station. A ‘friendly’ Ukrainian border control\n  operative accosted me and insisted I take a €25 taxi ride to the\n  frontier with a ‘taxi driver.’ Eventually, he claimed\n  that the train was cancelled, even though the notice board\n  clearly said it was due. When I repeatedly refused, the officer\n  grabbed my passport for ‘stamping’ and when he returned\n  it; the plastic on the information page had been lifted off,\n  rendering it invalid.

Last year, he even vowed\n  that \"from the start of 2015, all Ukrainians will have the\n  right to visit EU countries without a visa.\"\n  The situation looks markedly different now: not only have the\n  Ukrainians been slapped with even bigger legal hurdles necessary\n  to acquire a Schengen visa (including fingerprinting, among\n  others), the Europeans also aren’t willing to consider even a\n  six-year timeframe. As Schulz put it to Ukraine’s ‘Evropeyska\n  Pravda’ on Friday: “In six years?

Late May saw the release of a leaked\n  draft resolution, ahead of the Eastern Partnership Summit. In it,\n  German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged her counterparts not to\n  rush to a decision on Ukraine.\n“We must not create false expectations,” Merkel said,\n  speaking to the German parliament before leaving for the Eastern\n  Partnership Summit in Riga. The Eastern Partnership “is not\n  an instrument of enlargement politics for the European Union and\n  we must not make promises that we can’t fulfill,” Merkel\n  said at the time.\nREAD MORE: ‘No promises’ on EU membership for\n  Eastern states at Riga summit\n  The partnership was set up in 2009 to establish concrete steps\n  and ideas that would bring eastern-European states closer to\n  cooperation with the EU, including domestic reforms. In May, bloc\n  members had gathered in Latvia for a two-day summit to discuss EU\n  membership for eastern European states, including Ukraine. The EU\n  leaders are examining potential membership prospects for Armenia,\n  Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine, as well as\n  the development of its Eastern Partnership program.\n\n  Ukraine, however, did not get much from the summit, apart from a\n  loan and a vague promise of visa-free travel that was very\n  carefully paraded in front of Poroshenko, so as not to make any\n  concrete promises. Any talk of a Ukrainian membership at the\n  summit was non-existent.\n\n  But Poroshenko has been keeping busy. Just two days ago he\n  ratified a series of measures taken together\n  with the IMF to qualify for receiving a $1.7 billion loan,\n  following on from the €1.8 billion he just secured from the EU.\n\n  In another move toward the West, Poroshenko also signed\n  legislation that would allow foreign troops to be on Ukrainian\n  soil in the role of peacekeepers – something that was previously\n  impossible.\n\n  But as Schulz appears to be saying now, the “concrete\n  assurances” Poroshenko has been looking for are still a\n  while away.\n","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        Poroshenko’s pledge for Ukraine to join EU 'rather ambitious' – Euro Parliament president\n\n     \n\n    "}

We believe the preponderance of the ceasefire violations are on the part of separatist forces, again supplied and also helped by Russian military,” Toner said.Asked to provide any specifics on the ceasefire violations, the State Department deputy spokesperson referred RT correspondent to the OSCE and offered to look at “larger picture,” rather than focusing on specifics.However, the latest OSCE SMM report clearly states that “the SMM observed few ceasefire violations in Donetsk region, and none in Lugansk,” and even Toner had to admit that there was “relative calm today.”Toner said “we all understand” that “there would be no conflict” in eastern Ukraine “if Russia were not providing tanks, armored vehicles, heavy artillery, military personnel to the separatists.”So far, none of the satellite images, released by the US or NATO over more than a year of conflict in eastern Ukraine, showed anything except increased Russian military presence at the border with the conflict-torn neighboring country.In response to the sanctions, presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would reciprocate.

And we have seen a very important fall in amount of fighting and violence in eastern Ukraine. The second point is why it is damaging to the West, particularly Germany, which has a major involvement, but also Britain, where, you know, for instance, Russia has got involvement in the city of London. They do not seem to be putting those economic considerations ahead, at the top of agenda. Could it be that they are bowing to the American pressure on this? I think, largely, it is. But, secondly, as well, I think there is a point here that the West has got itself into a pickle over the way it portrays and it is almost accepting this idea that the Putin regime is on the par with the country like North Korea, one of the worst dictatorships since Saddam’s in Iraq. And it is clearly not the case. And most authorities in the West on Russia would turn around and say …the way the West is reacting to Russia and portraying Russia is frankly ludicrous. And it needs Russia’s help in a whole series of levels over what is happening in Syria, over the fight against ISIL, over the growing refugee crisis. Russia could be a great asset for the West in this. Russia is a part of international community. Why it has been treated as a pariah state when it is sticking by – and the point I think Russia has made today and a number of people have made today over the new American sanctions over the defense deals - by the international law on this. Why it has been treated in this way? And the West seems to get itself in a strange situation when it is trying to portray Russia as being axis of evil in the world today which does not fit the reality.READ MORE: New sanctions: US targets scores of Russian, Chinese, Syrian firms over IranRT: Are the sanctions effective and really harmful to the Russian economy?CB: Well, of course the removal of the sanctions would be a great step forward.

But I think it is important turn around and say that clearly the sanctions have not damaged the Russian economy that much. Clearly, Russia has been able to rebalance itself, particularly by re-orientating itself on China. It does not need to worry too much about the sanctions. For instance, American sanctions over defense deals with Russia – Russia does not do defense deals with the United States, it has got no involvement in this sphere. That is not going to damage. So, in a way Russia can just shrug it off, and carry on as before and actually say ‘Look, we are legitimately part of international community, we are going to stand by what we agree, we are going to stand by what we are committed to and so on.

And the first step should be by creating a common and united front against jihadist groups such as Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) and fighting them at their core.“We really want to form some kind of an international coalition, therefore we conduct consultations with our US partners,” Putin said, noting that he spoke about it with President Obama.However it is premature to discuss “direct” Russian involvement in military actions against ISIS, needless to say joining the US-led coalition, as Moscow is currently considering “other options,” said Putin.The issue of rebuilding local economies and social spheres to convince terrified people to move back would only arise after terrorism is rooted out, Russian President said. But international support for rebuilding the statehood of the countries which have suffered at the hand of ISIS should only occur with full respect for history, culture and local traditions.“But if we act unilaterally and argue about the quasi-democratic principles and procedures for certain areas, that will lead us to an even greater impasse,” Putin concluded.The Russian leader emphasized that he was being critical to figure out “what is happening, and what to do next,” rather than to tease or to point out that Western policies were “shortsighted.”Putin noted that the US is not facing a refugee crisis of the same magnitude as the EU, which has been “blindly following American orders.”Prior to Putin’s speech, the Russian Foreign Ministry said that the EU could actually learn something from Russia in terms of offering proper living conditions to those fleeing conflict zones.Reminding Brussels of Russia’s experience in dealing with the influx of civilians fleeing Kiev’s so-called “anti-terrorist operation” in neighboring Ukraine, the ministry's spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova said that hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled to Russia were provided with “shelter, food and aid.”","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        EU refugee crisis ‘absolutely expected’ – Putin\n\n     \n\n    "}

Despite seeing the same old movie of the Orange Revolution that was supposed to bring the break with the past in 2004, they are seeing the re-run of the same production.

The failed state that is a de-facto new Ukraine has reported cases of children paralyzed in Ukraine in a polio outbreak while the Kiev government is going to European capitals hat in hand asking for a military and political support. In this spirit Poroshenko just announced his new military doctrine that will redeploy and invest money the country doesn't have in the south and east as bulwarks against perceived \"Russian imperialism\".In other words the government will be defending itself against its own population in the east, its own ex-allies in Kiev while continuing its own propaganda war against Putin and the \"evil\" empire supported by the \"good\" empire in conjunction with austerity program imposed on whatever is left of the Ukrainian economy.This will in turn create a fantastic investment landscape for the foreign vulture investor class coming in and getting everything for pennies on the dollar. If the \"coupon\" privatization was ever a rip-off, wait to see this scheme playing out in free money environment cooked up by Western central banks and the US \"private\" Federal Reserve. If this is the recipe for success then I would hate to see the recipe for failure as in the parallel universe of Ukrainian political reality, the chocolate cake prepared by the chocolate king can obviously eat itself and be intact in the same time.

We all know that anybody\n  remotely seen as being sympathetic to the Russian point of view\n  simply cannot get published in almost all Western mainstream\n  media these days. Hence, for a young hack eager to prosper, the\n  obvious path is being as anti-Russian as possible.\n\n  Anyway, what really happened in Kiev is that the “Euromaidan”\n  episode didn’t herald a new dawn for principled democracy in\n  Ukraine. It merely replaced one corrupt gang of oligarchic\n  leeches with another. Now Ukraine has the richest head of state\n  in Europe, the billionaire Petro Poroshenko, while paying its\n  pensioners £5 a week. Ukraine makes Greece look like Narnia.\n\n  What you will never read in the Western press, by the way, is\n  that the same Poroshenko served as Minister for Trade in\n  Yanukovich’s government until December 2012. The same ‘regime’\n  that delivered average salaries over double what Poroshenko’s\n  ‘modernizing government’ currently manages. Last year, he\n  sponsored a ‘lustration’ law, aimed at purging members of\n  Yanukovich’s administration from state governance. People just\n  like himself.\n\n  Poroshenko's mendacity\n\n  As the Canadian writer Halyna Mokrushnyna pointed out in an\n  essential piece last week, there is also the\n  issue of Poroshenko’s serial fibbing. “Lies about a promised\n  visa-free regime to Europe that has \"acquired a fixed place in\n  the calendar for the first time,” Poroshenko says in his\n  speech, in spite of public statements of European officials\n  saying that they cannot name a date for the introduction of\n  visa-free entry to Europe for Ukrainians. Lies about plans to\n  hold a referendum on Ukraine's joining NATO, which \"we would\n  have easily won,” but will not held because \"this issue\n  will shake the country\" and its unity. \"So is Ukraine\n  united in this issue or no, Mr. President?” Mokrushnyna\n  asked.\n\n  The Russian domestic press often features must-read analysis of\n  Ukraine, but obvious issues with language prevent it being widely\n  read in the West. Thus, I feel obliged to select some points from\n  this marvelous Korrespondent article from Yuri Lukashin.\n  Lukashin asserts that Ukraine is now \"a banana republic\n  without bananas.\" Furthermore, he insists that the nation is\n  committing suicide. There is plenty of logic in his reasoning.\n\n  Ukraine’s income levels were already pathetic by European\n  standards under the previous set of ‘kleptocratic’ leaders. Under\n  the new gang of (Washington-approved) thieves, salaries are now\n  pretty horrendous even by African measures. Yet, Western hacks\n  continue to peddle the complete nonsense that Ukraine is changing\n  for the better. Kiev’s tightly-controlled media bangs the same\n  drum. Meanwhile, anybody capable of rational thought must surely\n  be starting to realize that Ukraine is behaving, more and more,\n  like the world’s largest, open-air, lunatic’s asylum.\n\n  Lukashin writes: “In the year following the great \"revolution\n  of dignity,” Ukraine has been successful in building towards a\n  specific type of economy, mostly similar to that of a \"banana\n  republic.” In fact, there is only one difference between\n  Ukraine’s current path and its banana brethren in faraway Africa,\n  Latin America, and Asia. That is complete lack of bananas.\n  “There are numerous reasons why the EU - and the West in\n  general - do not need Ukraine in its current form. It simply\n  doesn't fit the EU's political, economic, or cultural framework.\n  If it did, Ukraine would have successfully integrated already in\n  the previous 24 years it has tried to. If it did, the EU wouldn't\n  allow Ukrainian standards of living drop to African levels after\n  the \"pro-European\" violent takeover. Ukraine would enjoy the open\n  borders, economic benefits, and other hallmarks of European\n  acceptance it thought it would receive shortly after \"choosing\n  Europe,” he adds.\n\n  Pray for Ukraine\n\n  Of course, there is a question never asked by Western supporters\n  of Ukraine’s “European choice.” What exact role would Ukraine\n  fulfill in the EU, if it ever were allowed to join? While I\n  accept that the very thought is ludicrous, many frequently\n  embellish and claim that Kiev will eventually accede to the EU.\n  Brussels is incapable of saving Greece, so how would it finance a\n  decrepit state which makes Greece look like Switzerland? Also,\n  how would the British people react to 45 million (extremely poor)\n  Ukrainians gaining access to the UK labor market - and, more\n  importantly, its welfare system?\n“Ukraine was built for a different economic model, with\n  different markets and economic partners in mind. Specifically,\n  the giant Russian market, which supported Ukraine through\n  mutually beneficial trade, huge fossil fuel discounts, and\n  Soviet-era economic connections. Cooperation with Russia kept\n  Ukraine afloat until now and even provided an economic base\n  which, as it turned out, allowed the country to grow a sizable\n  population of hipsters and office workers that forgot why they\n  needed all this unfashionable and smelly industry,” argues\n  Lukashin.\n\n  Amid all this, the next economic ‘challenge’ facing Ukraine’s\n  embattled citizens is new ‘European-style’ utility bills due to\n  land in the coming weeks. Charges will be doubled, with a further\n  40 percent increase slated for the autumn. These new prices\n  create the very real possibility that utility charges could\n  exceed pensions. A potential humanitarian disaster is possible in\n  winter.\n\n  Lukashin concludes with these pertinent words, “The social\n  and economic catastrophe that the country keeps sliding towards\n  is, to large extent, the consequence of our citizens’ support of\n  the governments that got them there, the political ideals they\n  worshipped, as well as Ukrainians believing that everybody else\n  owes them something. The USA owes them because Ukraine is\n  supposedly fighting Russia. Europe, because Ukraine supposedly\n  protects it from Russia's supposed aggression and Russia, simply\n  because Ukrainians are so wise and great that Russians should\n  naturally admire and serve them.”\n  During the initial Euromaidan protests and subsequent coup, many\n  Ukrainians changed their social media profile pictures to an English\n  language graphic, titled “Pray for Ukraine.” While\n  things were far from perfect then, the real suffering had yet to\n  start.\nThe time to“Pray for Ukraine”is now.The statements, views and opinions expressed in this column are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of RT.","articleSrc":"RT","articleHeader":"\n\n        ​Ukraine - a ’Banana Republic’ without bananas\n\n     \n\n    "}

Seven months into a conflict over Ukraine that has seen at least 3,400 people killed, Putin predicted that the clash would not be the last to pit Russia and the United States against each other, excoriating the White House for imposing sanctions against his nation that he said were simply aimed at forcing Russia into submission. In nationally broadcast remarks that lasted nearly three hours, Putin gave no hint of concessions to Western consternation over Russia’s role in Ukraine, where Putin first pressured former president Viktor Yanukovych over his plans to sign a European-friendly trade deal, annexed the Crimean Peninsula after pro-European protesters forced Yanukovych’s ouster and then helped fuel a pro-Russian rebellion in eastern Ukraine. Russia “is not asking anyone for permission” in its conduct of world affairs, Putin said. Although there was little new substance in the angry address, it was a bitter distillation of Putin’s anti-American rhetoric at an annual forum originally intended to put a Western-friendly spin on Russia’s image. Putin speaks every year before the Valdai Club, a gathering of Western and Russian analysts, journalists and officials, some of whom are critical of the Kremlin. This year’s meeting was held in the Black Sea resort city of Sochi.

The Russian president said the United States is trying to remake the world for its own interests. (Mikhail Klimentiev/Ria Novosti/Kremlin Pool/European Pressphoto Agency)  In the past, Putin has used the forum to offer olive branches to those critics. Last year, he took questions from opposition lawmakers a day after his aides had offered them political concessions. Sometimes he has also made jokes. This year’s speech and question-and-answer session contained none of that image-polishing. Instead, Putin delivered an unsmiling, straightforward worldview that blasted the United States as taking advantage of its powerful post-Cold War position to dictate misguided terms to the rest of the world. Putin faulted the United States for a rise in global terrorism, a resumption of a global arms race and a general worsening of global security. “It never ceases to amaze me how our partners have been guilty of making the same mistakes time and again,” Putin said, accusing the United States of breeding terrorists by upsetting the established order in Syria, Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan. One participant said that he was left with the impression that the ouster of Yanukovych in Ukraine — a nation with deep historical and cultural ties to Russia — was the final straw that unleashed years of anti-Western anger. “It was an emotional broadside against U.S. foreign policy,” said one participant, Cliff Kupchan, a longtime Russia analyst who is chairman of the Eurasia Group, a New York-based political and business consultancy. “If this is a turning point,” Kupchan said, “we’re going from bad to worse.” Kupchan said that other meetings with Russian officials over the closed three-day conference left little optimism for a durable peace in Ukraine, where a Sept. 5 cease-fire has frequently been broken. He said that officials at the meeting saw Cyprus and Bosnia as models for handling Ukraine’s divisions. Neither is an exemplar of comity between ethnic groups. Russian officials also said that they still will not tolerate Ukraine’s establishing stronger ties with the European Union, suggesting that a 15-month delay in the effective date of a landmark trade deal simply delays yet another confrontation between Russia and Ukraine, Kupchan said. Putin offered brief praise to recent instances of Russia-Western partnership, such as removing Syria’s chemical weapons and the ongoing multi­lateral negotiations to halt Iran’s and North Korea’s nuclear programs. But that was just a brief moment in a long anti-Western diatribe. The real audience may not have been the assembled Valdai elite but Putin’s domestic electorate, which thrives on his delivering powerful and angry messages to the West, said Vladimir Frolov, a Moscow-based foreign policy expert and former diplomat. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Friday that “the United States does not seek confrontation with Russia, but we cannot and will not compromise on the principles on which security in Europe and North America rest.” “Our focus is on continuing to engage with Russia on areas of mutual concern,” she said.

Seven months into the bloody fighting that has seized Ukraine’s east, the rest of this fractious country, long split between competing tugs from Europe and Russia, is pointing its face more than ever toward the West. Ukraine elected the most pro-European parliament in its history Sunday — in part because the most pro-Russian parts of the country didn’t vote at all. Now some people in western Ukraine wish their nation could just walk away from the rebels who want to be a part of Russia. Residents of Lviv, where Soviet rule never erased elegant Austro-Hungarian architecture, have long been among the most determined in Ukraine to push their nation toward Europe. So the conflict has stirred powerfully contradictory emotions in people such as Sokolov, a leader of pro-European demonstrations here last winter, who wishes that Ukraine could shed the east even as he says that the country should fight to keep it. There are no mainstream voices suggesting Ukraine should actually spin off eastern Ukraine, since many people fear that if they don’t put up a fight, Russia will take as much of Ukraine as it can for itself. But few here in Lviv relish fighting for a territory to which they never felt strong ties. “I never thought Ukraine would be a part of Europe if we had Donbas. It is a depressive Soviet region,” Sokolov said in one of Lviv’s bustling coffeehouses, which are reminiscent of Vienna. “If we could talk about civilized ways to get rid of that area, I would support it.”   Ukrainian forces and pro-Russian separatists swap 25 fighters from each side, amid a fragile cease-fire in eastern Ukraine. (Reuters)   With Russia backing the rebels against the rest of Ukraine, Sokolov said, the choice is far from simple. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in March, after protesters ousted Russian-friendly Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. Then it helped fuel a separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine that has claimed at least 3,700 lives, according to U.N. estimates. “We’re not fighting for the east. We’re fighting for Ukraine against Russia,” he said. “We have to stop the war there before it spreads to other parts of Ukraine.” Since Ukraine gained its independence in 1991 when the Soviet Union split, control of this nation has seesawed between easterners and westerners. But critics say that national leaders, no matter their origin, were more focused on lining their own pockets than on building a stronger Ukraine. Western Ukraine has long harbored anti-Russian sentiments, and an anti-Soviet insurgency based in Lviv persisted well into the 1950s. The Ukrainian language and the Catholic Church separate western Ukraine from its eastern counterpart, where the Russian language and the Orthodox Church are predominant. After the fall of the Soviet Union, European-oriented western Ukrainians demanded more autonomy from Kiev. That desire crested in February, when anti-Yanukovych protesters, led in part by Sokolov, seized Lviv’s regional administration building, the local outpost of the central government. That meant that when pro-Russian demonstrators in the east did the same thing two months later in Donetsk, some western Ukrainians at first withheld judgment. The escalation into armed conflict quickly obliterated what might have been a more peaceful national discussion about decentralizing Ukrainian authority. “A lot of people are asking how we can live in one country with people who wanted to be part of Russia and were killing us. I don’t have an answer for that,” said Otar Dovzhenko, a journalism professor and blogger at the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv who participated in the pro-European demonstrations in the winter. “In my heart, I feel it would be easier to live apart from these people,” he said. “By my reason, I know we have to keep fighting for the territory.” Many people in Lviv say that Ukraine’s history, caught between shifting empires, makes them particularly cautious about any discussion of changing their borders. Portions of southwest Ukraine might fly off to Romania, other parts to Hungary. Lviv itself was once a part of Poland, whose border lies just 30 miles away. Poland’s post-Soviet success has helped push Lviv’s attitudes toward Europe. Poland’s economy was about the same as Ukraine’s in 1991 but has since tripled. Former Polish foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski last month told Politico that Russian President Vladimir Putin once spoke to the Polish premier about divvying Ukraine between Russia and Poland. Sikorski quickly retracted the accusation. But the fact that the discussion was even remotely plausible attests to Ukraine’s perilous position. Politicians say they are working to stitch the country back together. “This problem didn’t appear in a day,” said Andriy Sadovyi, the mayor of Lviv, speaking about eastern Ukraine. “For 20 years, the Ukrainian government did nothing to make them feel more Ukrainian. And Russia played a good game,” said Sadovyi, who fought on the side of the pro-European demonstrators and whose new Self-Help political party made a strong showing in Sunday’s parliamentary elections. As the conflict in the east escalated over the summer, more and more western Ukrainians volunteered to join the battle, seeing it as an existential threat to their nation. Some of the volunteers came from the Right Sector, the far-right nationalist group whose base is in Lviv and that has been demonized in Russia for ties to neo-Nazism. Some moderates also moved quickly from the pro-European demonstrations to the eastern battlefield. “People will fight to the end,” said Nazar, 27, a Lviv native and soldier who was mobilized to fight near the Luhansk airport this summer, the scene of particularly bitter combat. Fearing retaliation, he spoke on the condition that his last name not be published. “If it were a domestic problem, that would be one thing. But this is a foreign invasion,” he said. Thousands of refugees from the fighting in eastern Ukraine have streamed westward to Lviv, a development that has served as a vivid reminder that not all eastern Ukrainians wanted to secede from Ukraine. Opinion polls conducted in eastern Ukraine before the hostilities deepened showed that most residents there wanted to remain part of a single country. Some in Lviv cite that as a reason they want to keep fighting to preserve the country, although attitudes in eastern Ukraine have probably hardened toward Kiev after months of conflict. The reception for eastern Ukrainian refugees in Lviv and elsewhere has been decidedly mixed. Many refugees say they have been treated poorly by local residents, who blame them for starting the conflict.  Apartment owners “don’t want to rent to people from the east,” said Yevgenia Ivanova, a former resident of Donetsk who has tried for two months to find an apartment in Lviv where she could live with her husband and 2-year-old son and only moved into one last week.  “They believe that in total, all people from the east are angry beasts. They don’t understand that not everybody is the same,” she said. Ivanova said she had started to try to speak Ukrainian at home to fit in better. But she also said that many volunteers had helped her with food and supplies. Others are getting more tired of war, including some soldiers. Mothers and wives of soldiers have rallied several times in Lviv to campaign for their family members to be rotated home from the front after long deployments. In Kiev last month, several hundred members of the national guard rallied against mobilization. “They shouldn’t send any more of our boys there. They’re not well-equipped,” said Oksana Alyoshyna, the mother of a soldier who came to a parents’ protest in Lviv last week.  With rebel-held territories set to conduct elections Sunday, Ukraine’s divisions are poised to harden even more. The rest of Ukraine will face the question of how hard to fight for those territories it has lost. “Many people say it’s now more possible to have policy with more perspective, government with more perspective, because these regions kept Ukraine in aSoviet mentality,” said Myroslav Marynovich, the vice rector of the Ukrainian Catholic University. “Those same people would say that they are not for the division of Ukraine. These are diametrically opposed visions.” ","articleSrc":"WP","articleHeader":"In Ukraine’s European core, new weariness over war with pro-Russian rebels"}

Thousands of residents across war-torn eastern Ukraine lined up Sunday to give their backing to the current rebel leadership, which has been working to establish a new pro-Russian state in the southeast corner of the country. The vote, which was embraced by Russia  and condemned by Western and Ukrainian leaders, will change little in terms of leadership on the ground. But rebels said it would give them a measure of popular support in their negotiations with the central government in Kiev, and it underlined how fully Ukraine has lost control of the region. Rebel leaders have declared that an often-violated two-month-old cease-fire  is dead, and last week they said they plan to take over more territory that is vital for the establishment of their state.  A Ukrainian military spokesman said Sunday that Russian military support had been flowing into eastern Ukraine in recent days, and witnesses on Sunday reported long columns of unmarked military trucks traveling into the rebel stronghold of Donetsk. Ahead of the vote, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would recognize the results.

After the elections, he said, Kiev “will recognize us, give us our land back without a fight, and we will establish good diplomatic relations.” Zakharchenko, a former electrician at an eastern Ukrainian mine, took over leadership of rebels in the Donetsk region from a Russian citizen in early August. He was running Sunday against two little-known candidates. The leader of rebels in the Luhansk region, Igor Plotnitsky, a Soviet armed forces veteran and former civil servant, also was expected to win. Rebels had no access to voter registration rolls, and anyone could vote at any polling place he or she wanted, as well as online. Polling stations were crowded, with long lines, although there were fewer polling stations than for the Ukrainian parliamentary elections in 2012, and it was difficult to establish meaningful turnout figures. Many residents have fled to other parts of Ukraine and to Russia. Some witnesses saw gunmen at some of the polling stations. At other voting locations, people were selling cut-rate onions, cabbage and carrots. Russian lawmakers loyal to the Kremlin said that after the elections they may step up support for the rebels and the breakaway state they call New Russia. “The elections that are taking place today are lawful and civilized forms of realizing the right to self-determination for the people of New Russia,” Sergei Zheleznyak, the vice-speaker of Russia’s lower house of parliament, said in a statement on the Web site of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s political party, United Russia. Ukraine’s leaders were far less sanguine about the vote. Ukraine’s Security Service said Sunday that it had launched a criminal inquiry into the elections, and it declared persona non grata several far-right European politicians who had arrived in eastern Ukraine to watch the elections.

(Yuriy Streltsov/EPA)  “Ukraine and the entire civilized world will not accept this farce,” Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “I hope that Russia does not recognize these pseudo-elections!” Rebels appear to be seeking to establish an enclave similar to Transnistria in Moldova or South Ossetia in Georgia, two spots in former Soviet republics that the Kremlin has used to maintain leverage over national governments. But the rebel-controlled regions of eastern Ukraine are still deeply dependent on Kiev for electricity and other key resources. Rebels have struggled to find ways to pay civil servants and pensions, for which the Kiev government is no longer footing the bill, in the territory they control The separatist conflict began after Russia-friendly Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted by protesters in February. Russia then annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula, and separatist protesters seized eastern Ukrainian government buildings and territory starting in April. The fighting has killed more than 4,000 people, according to U.N. estimates, including hundreds since the cease-fire went into force Sept. 5.

Now, Russia can ignore that evidence — as well as any questions citizens might raise — since President Vladimir Putin signed a decree classifying certain peacetime deaths of soldiers as state secrets. Putin signed an order Thursday making the deaths of Russian troops lost during “special operations” a secret, amending a previous decree that limited such secrecy to deaths of soldiers in wartime. Some watchers can see only one plausible reason for the change: Russia is gearing up for another military push into Ukraine.  [Ukraine says it wants a missile shield to protect against Russian aggression]  “We’re in a pre­war situation. Right now there’s going to be another campaign in Ukraine,” said Pavel Felgenhauer, a military analyst based in Moscow, who added that Russia was being secret about losses­ because “we’re fighting a secret war.” But war brings about the sort of casualties that can serve as proof of Russia’s involvement in Ukraine, Felgenhauer pointed out. “If foreigners know about the losses­ of soldiers in Donbass, that’s not very good,” he said, using a term that refers to eastern Ukraine. “But more important is that the Russian public doesn’t know. So it’s going to be a secret, as it was in Soviet times.” Russia has long denied its troops are operating in Ukraine, dismissing as fabrications reports of training camps, troop build­ups and even the testimony of captured Russian soldiers claiming to be on active duty. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Thursday that the decree is a simple upgrade of state privacy laws that “has nothing to do with Ukraine” and that Putin had no plans to green light a special operation there.  Yet dead and missing soldiers speak to the Russian population louder than NATO satellite images­ tracking Russian troop movements. And last summer, as news of troops returning from Ukraine in caskets reached the Russian people, the government narrowly avoided an internal crisis. Eventually, mothers of Russian soldiers clamoring for information on their sons captured in Ukraine were muzzled, while politicians who publicized the secret funerals and burials of Russian soldiers thought to have died in Ukraine were reportedly beaten. Russia has a history of secrecy surrounding the deaths of troops. The country spares no ceremony celebrating its military victories and prowess, but there are still many families who don’t know what happened to their war dead, in World War II or any of the military campaigns that Soviet troops fought in the decades after. Russians don’t even know how many people who died in those conflicts were civilians vs. soldiers, because the state kept such figures secret. But one thing is sure: Much as they may support Putin’s Ukraine policies, Russians don’t want to repeat the experience of suffering mass losses­ over a conflict in another country. Last year, one state-run poll found that two-thirds of Russians opposed sending troops into Ukraine, while barely more than a quarter of the population supported the idea. Nonetheless, reports continue to emerge about how Russia has been building up its troop presence near the Ukrainian border. A Bloomberg report this week cited U.S. lawmakers claiming that Russia was operating mobile crematoriums in eastern Ukraine to hide its dead — and thus hide its involvement in the conflict. And then there’s the image that the decree’s terminology — “special operations” — drums up. “Special operations” is “a new term to identify a new reality\" without a legal definition, presidential Human Rights Council member Sergey Krivenko told Russian news outlet RBK on Thursday. But Russians have heard the term before during Putin’s presidency — in connection with such campaigns as the second Chechen war, the 2008 conflict in South Ossetia and, most recently, last year’s annexation of Crimea.

The deal proposed by Michael O’Hanlon and Jeremy Shapiro in their Dec. 7 op-ed, “A win for Russia, Ukraine and the West,” would not just be misguided — it would be dangerous. The premise of their argument that a “win-win-win outcome for Russia, Ukraine and the West is far smarter than zero-sum thinking” runs counter to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s exclusively “zero-sum” view of the world. If we have learned anything from the Obama administration’s failed “reset” with Russia, it is that Putin unfailingly seeks to exploit the West’s futile pursuit of “win-win” deals.  To get Putin to behave, O’Hanlon and Shapiro proposed granting him a veto over anything the European Union and NATO would do vis-à-vis Russia’s neighbors, thereby consigning Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and other countries to a Russian sphere of influence. There would be no more NATO enlargement, and any European Union relationship with Ukraine would have to meet with Moscow’s approval and not interfere with Russia’s Eurasian Economic Union project. Countries join the latter because they face tremendous Russian pressure to do so; they join the European Union and NATO because they see it in their own best interests.  Putin clearly is not interested in seeing Ukraine succeed; in fact, he fears that a democratic, European-oriented Ukraine would pose an attractive alternative to his authoritarian system. Putin undermines his neighbors’ independence and right to pursue deeper integration with the West because of his zero-sum way of thinking. He sees movements calling for liberalization and democracy and against corruption and authoritarianism as threats to his own power. When Viktor Yanukovych, Putin’s partner in Ukraine, fled the country in February, Putin invaded to make sure that Russians wouldn’t get the idea that they could produce a similar result in Moscow. How can one build a new, pan-European security structure, as O’Hanlon and Shapiro proposed, with someone who sees everything the West represents as his biggest threat?  Giving Putin any say over his neighbors’ policies would be the height of irresponsibility, yet O’Hanlon and Shapiro proposed holding a referendum to determine Crimea’s future. Instead, the West should stick to its policy of nonrecognition of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, even if it takes years to return the region to Ukraine, just as it never recognized the absorption of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union. Since 2004, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have been proud members of NATO and the European Union — and are no doubt thankful they have security guarantees from the alliance’s Article 5 in light of Russia’s rising threat.  The source of tensions between the West and Russia lies with the nature of the Putin regime. To justify his invasion, Putin fabricated stories that Russian speakers and ethnic Russians, first in Crimea and then in eastern Ukraine, were under threat. In reality, no such threats existed. Putin did not cite NATO enlargement — in large part because nobody was discussing the idea of Ukraine joining the alliance. NATO had nothing to do with Putin’s decision. To the extent that it exists at all, the prospect of Ukraine’s membership in NATO is a far-off possibility, but O’Hanlon and Shapiro would take it off the table entirely, overturning the alliance’s decades-old “open door” policy. For the first time, a small majority of Ukrainians may want to join NATO. How demoralizing for them if NATO, on top of refusing to provide Ukraine with the military means to defend itself, were to shut the door to membership. Putin would read such a decision as open season on Ukraine and its other non-NATO neighbors.  Russia’s most secure, stable borders are with countries that belong to NATO, the European Union or both. The idea that NATO, a defensive organization, is a threat to Russia is nonsense. It would be a huge mistake to follow O’Hanlon and Shapiro’s recommendation that NATO refocus on missions outside Europe when the biggest danger the alliance faces today is Russia. Indeed, Putin’s Russia is a grave threat to its immediate neighbors, to the West and to global stability more broadly.  In their proposed deal, O’Hanlon and Shapiro demand plenty from the West. What would be asked of Putin? He would be required to retreat from eastern Ukraine and pledge to uphold Ukraine’s territorial integrity. But Putin lied about the invasion of Crimea this year, continues to deny that Russian forces are in eastern Ukraine and broke his promises to abide by the Sept. 5 cease-fire. Why should his agreement on a new deal mean anything? After the terrible toll Russia has inflicted on its neighbor — including the loss of thousands of lives — it would be unconscionable to give Putin effective veto power over Ukrainian and Western decision-making. The right way to deal with such a threat is by ramping up sanctions, supporting Russia’s neighbors and providing the military assistance Ukraine needs to defend itself. We must contain Putin, not compromise with him or pursue naive “win-win” approaches that would only weaken our security and that of our friends and allies.

At the public kickoff of a discussion here about U.S. policy toward Russia and Ukraine, former defense secretary Robert Gates joked that his favorite definition of diplomacy was “petting a dog and saying ‘nice doggie’ until you can find a rock.”   David Ignatius writes a twice-a-week foreign affairs column and contributes to the PostPartisan blog. View Archive   Facebook RSS   Sometimes, U.S. global strategy can be as haphazard as that. But something close to a coherent, consensus policy toward Russia emerged over four days of debate by the Aspen Strategy Group, a gathering of senior current and former officials, plus some think tank leaders and journalists. The discussions were off the record, but members were encouraged to share the contours of the debate and its conclusions.  The discussions converged on an approach that resists President Vladimir Putin’s push in Ukraine while continuing to engage Russia economically and politically. “Don’t give in to Putin, but don’t give up on Russia” is how one participant summed up the group’s conclusion.  “How can we deter Putin from further aggression in Ukraine and drive up the costs to him while, at the same time, keep[ing] the lines open to him on nuclear security, proliferation and Iran?” That’s how Nick Burns, a Harvard professor and the group’s director, summed up the discussion in a message after the conference.        1 of 8       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                       Skip Ad   ×           The low points of the Putin years      View Photos   When Vladi­mir Putin came to office in 2000, the former KGB man promised to bring about change in Russia.

The balance of Republicans and Democrats was roughly equal, and the conclusions were somewhat more hawkish than Obama administration policy. But, like the White House, the group agreed on the need for engagement and “off ramps” that open a path for Russia to accept a sovereign but nonhostile Ukraine.  The plan to send humanitarian aid, administered by the International Committee of the Red Cross, in Russian convoys across the border into eastern Ukraine was just taking shape as we met, with some arguing that this was a face-saving exit for Putin and others countering that it was a cover for Russian invasion.  One continuing theme was the fundamental weakness of Russia, despite Putin’s cocky attempt at “redux” that seeks to reassert Soviet-era prerogatives. One presenter described Russia’s demographic disaster: a shrinking population; a chronic health crisis that puts Russia between Tanzania and Angola in male life expectancy; a dearth of entrepreneurship, so that the nation ranks below Alabama in patents awarded over the past 10 years.  Given these devastating numbers, noted a panelist, it’s clear that Russia is in decline. The question is whether Russia will experience a sudden decline or a gradual one. The consensus was that U.S. interests wouldn’t be served by fast decline and the resulting instability.  At the beginning of the retreat, there was sharp criticism of “Putinism” and its arrogant assertion of Russian power. Some argued that Putin was “delusional” in thinking he could restore the prerogatives of the Soviet Union. But others cautioned that Putin’s actions were a predictable reaction to Russia’s humiliation after the crack up of the U.S.S.R. — and that the United States (unlike the impulsive Putin) should play what one former Cabinet official called “the long game.”  Putin had made three big mistakes in Ukraine, noted one commentator. He thought the battle for eastern Ukraine would be a walkover for his covert proxy forces, as Crimea was; he thought the pro-Russian separatists could be controlled; and he thought the newly elected government of President Petro Poro­shenko would be weak and short-lived.  As the Aspen discussions progressed, participants focused increasingly on positive steps the United States could take to complement the negative pressure of sanctions. Helping Poroshenko’s Ukraine to become a stronger, less-corrupt nation was a priority, and one participant suggested that the United States lead an international reconstruction program for the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine.  Helping Ukraine resist a Russian invasion was a consensus point. There was agreement that a direct U.S. or European military intervention was unlikely, but many participants argued that it would be wise to send lethal-weapons assistance to Ukraine. Several also noted that the United States should quietly advise Ukraine on ways to make an invasion costly for Russia.  Through the four days of discussion, there was a tension between the “squeezers” and the “dealers,” as one participant characterized the meeting’s hawks and doves. But interestingly, the split didn’t fit party lines. In the freewheeling discussion, Democrats sometimes argued a tougher line than Republicans.  The Aspen group was celebrating its 30th anniversary, under the chairmanship of Harvard professor Joseph Nye and former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft. Suffice it to say that this is the way the policy-formulation process is supposed to work in America, but it rarely does.

(Robert Orttung)  The following is a guest post by Sean R. Roberts and Robert Orttung of George Washington University. ***** A “War of Lapels” is raging as many people in the post-Soviet space must make political choices about what to wear on their jackets on May 9 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. How citizens accessorize broadcasts their position on the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In many ways, Vladimir Putin has framed Russia’s conflict with Ukraine over the past year around a particular historical narrative of World War II that promotes a mélange of Soviet greatness with Russian nationalism, while branding Ukrainians as fascists. The Kremlin storyline of World War II is in stark contrast to the narrative honored by most living in Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe, where remembering the war is not related to present-day political disputes but honors the sacrifices of family members alive at that time. This transformation of the Soviet narrative of the war into a Russian nationalist one has been particularly apparent in Russian-Ukrainian relations. In response to Ukraine’s rehabilitation of Stepan Bandera, for example, Russia publicly condemned the Ukrainian government and frequently characterized western Ukrainians as fascists on Russian television. In addition, Moscow sought to convince Russian-speaking Ukrainians and the citizens of other post-Soviet states of the dangers of a growing anti-Russian Ukrainian fascism. In the run-up to the May 9 holiday this year, Moscow is promoting its connections between World War II and the war in eastern Ukraine through an unlikely strategy – by trying to monopolize the lapels of post-Soviet citizens. This situation has its origins in an ingenious, participatory, and continually evolving Russian nationalist propaganda campaign originally created by Putin’s administration in 2005 as part of the 60th anniversary of Victory Day – the wearing of the Ribbon of St. George or the Georgievskaya Lenta. Since 2005, the Georgievskaya Lenta, an orange-and-black-striped ribbon associated with an 18th century czarist Russian military medal, has become an increasingly important part of celebrating the end of World War II in Russia, and it has also been exported by Russia to other post-Soviet states as an overtly Russian symbol of these states’ shared history in the Soviet defeat of Nazi Germany. [How the Soviet Union saved the world from Hitler]    People hold a 278-foot-long St. George’s Ribbon, after climbing up onto Mount Beshtau, near Zheleznovodsk in Stavropol region of Russia, on May 3. (Eduard Korniyenko/Reuters)  While this ribbon has generated controversy in the non-Russian post-Soviet states since its introduction in 2005, over the past two years the ribbon has taken on more overtly Russian nationalist meaning in the context of the Russian-Ukraine war. As a result, the ribbon no longer only represents a remembrance of those from throughout the Soviet Union who gave their lives to defeat Nazi Germany; it also represents a symbol of Russia’s historical and present role in preventing the spread of what it calls fascism, which includes its efforts to undermine Ukraine’s present government. In this sense, the wearing of the Georgievskaya Lenta now also expresses explicit support of Putin’s nationalist agenda in Russia and opposition to Ukraine’s new government and its reform efforts. As one might expect, it is very unlikely that Ukrainians outside those areas controlled by the Russian-backed rebels will wear the Georgievskaya Lenta this year on May 9. In the context of the war, Ukrainians are becoming only more united in their patriotism and opposition to Russia. Furthermore, the Ukrainian government has decided to adopt a different decoration to celebrate the defeat of Nazism this year – a poppy flower, mimicking that worn throughout the British Commonwealth nations and in the United States.    Screen shot of Ukrainian TV showing the usage of a poppy to commemorate World War II.  This symbolic “war of lapels” has spread throughout the post-Soviet space and threatens to divide the populations of many former Soviet states at a time when they would otherwise be celebrating peace and the sacrifices of their loved ones who had suffered so much during World War II. In Moldova, the Liberal party has taken a strong stance against the Russian World War II narrative, seeking to outlaw the Georgievskaya Lenta as a foreign military symbol. In an attempt to avoid appearing to either support or condemn the Russian narrative, Kyrgyzstan has quietly created their own version of the Russian ribbon by replacing its colors with those of the Kyrgyz flag (red and yellow). In Kazakhstan, which is one of Russia’s closest allies, but also has a large, often restless ethnic Russian minority and is desperately trying not to take sides in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the state has also created its own Kazakh ribbon based on its national flag adorned with Soviet medals. So as not to appear to be countering Russia’s distribution of the Georgievskaya Lenta in Kazakhstan, the state has been careful to point out that citizens can wear any lapel decoration they choose. Although this strategy is in line with Kazakhstan’s usual “multi-vector” foreign policy, it is also inviting tension in the country as groups of citizens are beginning to mobilize both for and against the Georgievskaya Lenta. At a time when many former Soviet citizens wish to honor a generation who gave so much to stop Nazi aggression 70 years ago, this war of symbols is only polluting popular memory and manipulating it to promote current political purposes. Putin’s strategy of using WWII-era victories to support his own aggression in eastern Ukraine will likely backfire over the long run, at least among those former Soviet citizens living outside Russia. In particular, it likely will create new divisions and conflicts within those post-Soviet states seeking to remain neutral in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.","articleSrc":"WP","articleHeader":"How to understand the post-Soviet ‘war of lapels’"}

Mikheil Saakashvili, the crusading ex-president of Georgia, is trying to upend Ukraine’s most lawless region as the new governor of the smuggling stronghold of Odessa. A man who led his tiny nation into war with mighty Russia has taken up a new fight in a high-profile appointment in a fellow post-Soviet state that was a slap at the Kremlin. Western officials say that Saakashvili’s anti-corruption assault will be as crucial in the effort to break Ukraine free from its ex-Soviet masters as the country’s shooting war with Russian-backed rebels — and that the hot-headed Georgian has just months to get it done. Public disillusionment with Ukraine’s new leaders is building amid a rising sense that last year’s wave of protests delivered little but fresh misery. Citizens say they still face demands for bribes nearly every time they encounter a government official. Many fear that Ukraine’s leaders will fail altogether and that the country will fall back into Russia’s sphere. “Ukraine is a big revolution, and in my way I am a revolutionary,” Saakashvili said in an interview in his office, which is decorated with a bust of Ronald Reagan, the man often credited in Eastern Europe with taking down the Soviet Union. With old habits holding firm, many of Ukraine’s international partners, including the United States, are reconsidering the amount of assistance they can provide if the nation cannot help itself.

(John Wendle/for The Washington Post)  That gives an outsize importance to Saakashvili’s effort, which Western diplomats say they are treating as a test case for whether reforms can take hold. Saakashvili has given himself until the end of the year to overhaul Odessa, said a Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on internal discussions. If Saakashvili fails, the diplomat said, “the window closes for 10 years” on domestic support for Ukrainian reforms. The Obama administration sees the Odessa efforts as so vital that it has committed up to $2 million in direct assistance and has sent numerous top State Department officials to visit Saakashvili. U.S. money is going to foundations that hire top Saakashvili associates to implement changes. U.S.-paid lawyers are studying the structure of the crime-ridden port. Officers from the California Highway Patrol are training new police officers to replace the detested old ones. “Ukraine today is fighting two wars. One is the war with Russia,” the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Geoffrey R. Pyatt, said last month. “The other is the war against corruption, the war for reform, the war to move Ukraine towards the standards of modern European democracy that the Ukrainian people have sought.” The region of Odessa “in many ways is the front line for that second war,” Pyatt said. Crusade against corruption Saakashvili, a brash Columbia University-trained lawyer, rose to power in Georgia in 2003 and shook his Caucasian nation out of a post-Soviet stupor with a crusade against corruption that rocketed the country to the top of international ratings for transparency. His ravenous appetite for politicking is Clintonian. But after he launched into war with Russia in 2008, his country suffered a catastrophic defeat within days. Critics say he became increasingly intolerant of dissent. He lost power in 2013 and fled the country to avoid charges of abuses of power that he says are politically motivated. Saakashvili swooped into Odessa at the end of May, taking over a Russian-speaking region of 2.4 million residents whose alliances are split between Kiev and Moscow. The surprise appointment provoked feverish warnings that he was there to stoke hatred of ethnic Russians, although he has tamped down his old fiery anti-Kremlin rhetoric and has won grudging support from members of the ethnic Russian community who detest corruption as much as ethnic Ukrainians. If Saakashvili fails, Ukraine could soon boomerang back into Russia’s orbit — with gloomy consequences for Georgia, which is feeling the same competing tugs.   Beachgoers take the sun on the seashore in Odessa next to a wall torn down by newly placed Governor Mikheil Saakashvili to show that wealthy businessmen are not above than the law in Ukraine, August 5, 2015. (John Wendle/for The Washington Post)  “Before if you were involved in governance, you were involved in corruption. It’s very difficult to be dry when you’re in the sea,” Saakashvili told a crowd this past week in Kominternivske, riling them in staccato but fluent Russian. Many in the town of 7,000 said that such a high-ranking official had never bothered to listen to their concerns before, much less travel there by marshrutka, the shuddering, packed minibuses that are the main public transit in rural Ukraine. At the sweltering open-air conclave, held in a dusty square under whispering plane trees, Saakashvili listened while dozens of residents detailed their daily struggles with public officials who sounded more like marauding bandits than civil servants. He quickly won over the crowd with his enthusiastic denunciations of their detested officials. The event was unusual in Ukraine, where politicians typically steer clear of such unvarnished back-and-forth with constituents. “To get a child in kindergarten, you have to pay a bribe. If someone dies, you have to pay even more,” Saakashvili told them, describing the corruption that has driven Ukrainians to twice overthrow their leaders since 2004. One farmer’s fields were stolen through a feat of paperwork. A mother had to pay bribes for a day-care spot for her son. A soldier on crutches watched his disability benefits drop into the pockets of the officials charged with passing them on to him. “I thought we had some mistakes in the system and we could fix the mistakes, and we’d be okay. It turns out the whole system is a mistake,” said Yulia Marushevska, 25, a Saakashvili deputy and a political novice who rocketed to international attention for her dramatic video dispatches last year from the Maidan, the central Kiev square that was the focal point of pro-European protests. Following the playbook Many of Saakashvili’s recruits are similarly young, Western-educated activists who have no previous political experience. He says he has no idea what the more than 800 employees of his regional administration do, and he has vowed to fire half of them, along with most of Odessa’s hated police force, which he says is “basically a criminal syndicate.” And he has promised to clean up the crime-ridden ports of the city of Odessa, a hub for smuggling, drug trafficking and bribery. He has taken on some broadly popular issues. He took a bulldozer to knock down an illegally constructed wall that blocked off a portion of a public beach at a property owned by a former lawmaker. On national television, he chewed out the head of Ukraine’s national airline, who was quickly fired amid charges of corruption. He has vowed a new police force by next month. But critics say that although Saakashvili has made grand promises, he has so far done more to change the tone than the substance of the system. Some question whether he will stay long enough to make sure that his reforms actually stick. Others say that his team is too inexperienced to take on Odessa’s formidable entrenched groups. And he can do little to boost the miserly pay that leads government bureaucrats making $80 a month to seek bribes just to survive. “He wants to build dreams, but he doesn’t have the instruments,” said Irina Medushevskaya, an Odessan political commentator. At an Odessa police training academy one morning recently, 200 new police recruits were practicing handcuffing each other under the watchful eye of two trainers who had been flown in from the California Highway Patrol, one more marker of U.S. involvement in the region. A total of 400 new trainees, none of whom have law enforcement experience, will hit the streets next month after just seven weeks of practice. The efforts, led from Kiev by a Georgian who was once a top official in Saakashvili’s presidential administration, mirror those of the first years of his rule there. Many recruits said they are motivated by a desire to build clean new institutions. But a Ukrainian trainer said low salaries could lead to problems. “You should pay enough so that a person doesn’t think about how to feed their families,” Stepan Kostev said. For now, Saakashvili says he will keep following the Georgian playbook to reform his new country. “There’s a general perception that you cannot transplant politicians. They get rejected by national organisms, like a heart or a liver,” he said. “But we have matching DNAs.”  Natalie Gryvnyak contributed to this report.

(Efrem Lukatsky/Associated Press)  On Aug. 9, 2015, a senior Russian general declared that if the Ukrainian military crosses Russia’s red line and attempts to recapture the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, Russia would respond with overwhelming force. This statement reaffirms the Kremlin’s official line that Russia needs to hold onto territory it has virtually annexed in Donbas to ensure the viability of its puppet republics, Donetsk and Luhansk. But is it true? Here’s another theory. It could be that President Vladimir Putin regards the takeover of Donbas territories as temporary, and is evaluating this occupation with a strict cost-benefit analysis. Right now, he has concluded that small military victories in the Donbas generate more than enough political capital in Russia to offset the Russian public’s disdain for the hardships of sanctions-induced austerity. [Hey, Putin, have you seen how much China is investing in Ukraine?] Should that assessment change, Putin is very likely to tactically withdraw from Donbas on his own terms. Putin will not regard this withdrawal as a defeat, as Russia will retain a military force in Crimea that could be used to destabilize Ukraine if it tries to join NATO. Three factors suggest that Putin’s commitment to retaining control over the territories is weaker than his regime’s rhetoric indicates:  Russia’s military presence in and occupation of Donbas territory is much less popular among Russian-speaking Ukrainians than Putin initially predicted in 2014.   The Ukrainian government has more power than it has used in the conflict thus far, and it could use this influence to force Putin to back down sooner than expected in Donbas.   There is compelling evidence that Putin’s long-term goal is to create a “frozen conflict” in Donbas, a scenario in which active fighting is suspended but ethnic tensions remain and can reignite at any time.  In addition, withdrawal from territories in Donbas would relieve Russia of the costs of occupation. Let’s examine these factors in turn. 1. The Donbas Russian speakers don’t like the occupation Russia would have a difficult time controlling the Donbas in the long-term because its imperialism is unpopular there. Putin did not expect mass resistance from Russian speakers in eastern Ukraine, but that’s what he has gotten. Prominent Ukrainian analysts such as International Democracy Institute Director Sergiy Taran argue that Putin extended his military campaign from Crimea to Donbas because he thought Russian speakers would greet him as a liberator. [Yes, Ukraine is still in crisis. Would becoming a ‘buffer state’ help?] By contrast, Western analysts knew that Russian incursions into Donbas would be unpopular, given trends documented in public opinion polls. Oxford political scientists Paul Chaisty and Stephen Whitefield argued in 2014 that as few as 4 to 6 percent of people in Donetsk and Luhansk supported outright separatism. A May 2014 opinion poll showed that only 19 percent of Kharkiv’s citizens supported the Russian occupation. The same poll showed that in Odessa, a Russian-majority city, Putin registered only 14 percent support. Former Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili, a staunch enemy of the Kremlin, is now a highly popular governor in Odessa. That opposition is why Putin’s military foray into eastern Ukraine shocked most observers. 2. Whether Russia’s military operations can keep the Donbas territories is beyond Putin’s control Few analysts seem to recognize the Ukrainian government’s important role and latent power in shaping events. The leverage that the Ukrainian government has in abeyance could cause Putin to opt for withdrawal rather than risk a potentially disastrous military escalation. [Why the U.S. does nothing in Ukraine] Consider the fact that Russian forces swiftly occupied some regions of eastern Ukraine but did not emerge victorious in others. For example, Russian forces were able to easily take over parts of Donetsk and Luhansk, but failed to triumph in other cities with large ethnic Russian populations, like Dnipropetrovsk and Kharkiv. Russia’s early successes were attributable in part to poor coordination between the Ukrainian government and regional oligarchs who profoundly impact military operations on the ground. Lucan Way, a University of Toronto professor and expert in post-Soviet regimes, agreed with this theory, in a recent interview with me. He believes that Russia’s initial successes were partially attributable to miscommunications between the Ukrainian government and eastern Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. Way argued that if the Ukrainian government had been more willing to make a deal with Akhmetov, Russian aggression could have been thwarted earlier. If the Ukrainian government can learn from this experience and coordinate more closely with regional oligarchs, it will be able to confront Russian aggression from a position of greater strength. There are other ways the Ukrainian government can still influence events. For instance, the Ukrainian state could strengthen itself economically through tighter relationships with the European Union and China. Should this work, Ukraine’s decreased dependency on trade with Russia, and increased capital for arms production, would greatly increase its military power relative to pro-Russian separatists in the Donbas. Ukraine could also deter further Russian aggression by increasing the costs of Russian military involvement. If the Ukrainian government can coordinate with its oligarchs to escalate counterterrorism efforts against pro-Russian separatist militias, and procure lethal arms or technical support from its Western allies, more Russian soldiers would perish in Donbas. That would make a tactical withdrawal a more cost-effective, politically justifiable strategy for Putin. 3. Putin wants a frozen conflict. It costs less and threatens more.   Since the Soviet Union dissolved, Russia has had one especially common pattern in its military interventions in the Commonwealth of Independent States, the region directly around its southern seas: frozen conflict, which would work well in Ukraine. [Russians see Ukraine as an illegitimate state] To see how this approach works, let’s look at what happened in Transnistria, a small strip of land on the Moldova-Ukraine border. In accordance with the cease-fire agreement ending the 1992 war between Moldova and Transnistria, Russia stationed 2,000 troops in Transnistria. These troops prevented the autonomous region from rejoining either Moldova or Russia. Moldova denounced this Russian military presence as a violation of international law because it infringes on Moldovan sovereignty. Russia has resisted international pressure to withdraw its military force because its presence deters Moldova from applying for NATO membership. Frozen conflicts are typically created as a result of settlements in countries beset with deep-seated ethnic tensions. Before 2014, Ukraine’s ethnic tensions were not high enough to threaten civil war. In fact, substantial evidence suggests that Russia manufactured ethnic tensions before its military intervention to prepare for a frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine. Oxford University Professor Roy Allison in his 2013 book “Russia, the West and Military Intervention” describes how the Kremlin alarmed the Ukrainian government by distributing Russian passports to Crimean citizens during the 2008 war between Russia and Georgia. Then Putin was able to use the pretext of protecting Russian civilians to justify moving Russian forces into Crimea and Donbas. The passports prove that Russia had long planned to set up a frozen conflict here as well. While the methods used in Russia’s interventions in Moldova and Ukraine differ, Russia will likely emulate the Moldovan frozen conflict strategy in Ukraine, due to deep ethnic tensions in both states and Russia’s common objective of keeping both countries in its sphere of influence. Russia will therefore keep troops on the Ukraine border should it tactically withdraw from the Donbas territories. The implicit threat would be the same as in Moldova: enter NATO and risk war. The threat would be backed by Russia’s permanent hold on the Black Sea naval base of Sevastopol. Meanwhile, if Russia were to end its occupation and create a frozen conflict, it could save some rubles. Consider that it will eventually need to subsidize pensions in eastern Ukraine, which by late 2014 were $2.6 billion in arrears. Indirect imperialism would be much more cost-effective. Some analysts of Russian conduct are succumbing to new Cold War hysteria when they assume that Donbas is being incorporated into a new Russian empire. That view is contradicted by realities on the ground and by Russia’s past conduct after military interventions. Russia’s real objective is to influence Ukraine’s foreign policy. It can do that best without further territorial expansion.

His book “Imperial Gamble: Putin, Ukraine and the New Cold War” will be published this month.   The war in Ukraine has slipped off the front pages. Eighteen months ago, when Russian President Vladimir Putin seized Crimea and then instigated a pro-Russian rebellion in the Donbas region, Ukraine was hot news. Putin was roundly denounced, and Russia was hit with damaging economic sanctions. East-West relations soured badly, and diplomats wondered whether they were witnessing the beginnings of another cold war. Now Ukraine, as a European crisis, has lost its urgency. One reason is the rush of other news, from global economic jitters and the flood of desperate Arab and African migrants to Europe to the preoccupying nuttiness of the U.S. presidential campaign. But there is another equally important reason. Putin seems to have won his little war in Ukraine, and his Western critics watch from the sidelines, sputtering with helpless rage. Roughly a year ago, Putin faced one of the biggest decisions of his presidency: whether to strike a compromise deal with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko or openly commit his troops and tanks to the war. Much to the surprise of many observers, the Ukrainian army and militias seemed a battle away from defeating Putin’s rebels. Putin, facing defeat, doubled-down and ordered his forces to cross the border and turn back the Ukrainian advance. He clearly wanted to prove to Poroshenko and his Western backers that in a war between Russia and Ukraine, Russia would win.  Within a few weeks, Putin and Poroshenko reached agreement on a rickety cease-fire, which predictably did not hold. Early this year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel rushed to negotiate another cease-fire, but she knew, as did President Obama, that it depended in large part on whether Poroshenko and his Kiev colleagues would extend recognition (a form of legitimacy) to rebel leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk and grant them autonomous status within Ukraine. This was and remains a bitter pill for Poroshenko to swallow. He faces violent opposition from right-wing extremists, and he runs a fragile country in serious economic and political trouble. More important, perhaps, he knows by now that neither Germany nor the United States will fight for Ukraine. Yes, they will offer warm words of support, modest financial and military assistance, of course — but apparently little more.  In this environment of caution and retreat, Putin has, slowly but surely, “frozen” the conflict, much as he did in 2008 in the former Soviet republic of Georgia. Far more than Western leaders, Putin can now influence and, when necessary, control the flow of economic, political and diplomatic developments in Ukraine.  For this “victory,” Putin has had to pay a heavy price. His economy has floundered, his reputation has suffered and Russia has experienced a return to domestic disorder and discontent that is real, even spreading. But as yet this has not had any discernible effect on his position within Russia. He seems perfectly capable of retaining his almost dictatorial grip on political power. I sometimes dream an impossible dream — that somehow we could magically transport Ukraine into Western Europe, where it would prosper as a Western democracy with a vibrant economy. It deserves such a future. But we cannot. Ukraine will always share a common border with Russia in much the same way that it shares a common culture, language and religion with Russia. For most of its existence, Ukraine has been a part of Russia, separating itself as an independent nation only in 1991, when the Soviet Union disintegrated. Ukraine lives uncomfortably in Russia’s “near abroad,” its backyard, its “sphere of influence.” Whether we like it or not, Russia is the dominant power in Eastern Europe, and no solution to the current crisis can realistically emerge unless and until Russia and Ukraine work out an acceptable modus vivendi between them. Putin’s attitude toward Ukraine is similar to that of other Russian leaders. He is not breaking new ground. His definition of nirvana is a Slavic confederation consisting of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine — all, as he puts it, “historically Russian land.” Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, he labels “the mother of all Russian cities,” and he speaks of the “aspiration of the Russians, of historical Russia . . . of ancient Rus,” as Russia and Ukraine bound together by a common history of more than a thousand years.  Putin can tolerate an independent Ukraine so long as it is “friendly” to Russian national interests, and, as any good despot, he trusts only himself to define this friendship. Down the road, he has hinted that he would like to convene a Yalta-type conference, at which he and other world leaders would redraw the map of post-1991 Europe. It’s not a very likely possibility, but Putin thinks he has time. He has Ukraine squirming in the palm of his hand, and he sees his Western adversaries as weak, divided, corrupt and, maybe, in this circumstance, ready to strike a deal to his liking.

(Efrem Lukatsky/AP)  There are multiple accounts suggesting that there was actually a productive meeting among the foreign ministers of Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine earlier this week over the conflict in eastern Ukraine. According to the BBC: [German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter] Steinmeier said all parties reaffirmed that the ceasefire, which has held for almost two weeks, needed to be consolidated. The warring sides were now “very close” to a deal that would see the withdrawal of heavy weapons from the frontline, he added. He also said there was some progress on the legal groundwork towards holding local elections in eastern Ukraine in October. If the conflict in Ukraine has stabilized while, at the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin has deployed more military force to Syria, what does it mean? Shockingly, commentators are split on this question.  My colleague Jackson Diehl thinks it’s a sign that Putin is winning: Some analysts claim that a floundering Putin is meddling in the Middle East out of desperation because his bid for Ukraine has failed. But another way to see it is this: Putin’s use of force succeeded in inducing the West to accept his Ukraine demands — and he is trying to repeat his triumph in a second theater…. Well, that’s possible, but as Diehl’s embedded links suggest, there’s another way of interpreting the emerging cease-fire. For example, the German Marshall Fund’s Ulrich Speck writes: Russia will not announce defeat in Ukraine. But Ukraine’s resistance against the Russian-led attack in Donbas in combination with support from the West has made it impossible for Moscow to win back control over Ukraine any time soon without a major war. Instead of falling back into Russia’s sphere of domination, Ukraine has started along the long and hard road toward building a liberal-democratic nation state…. [N]either Ukraine nor the West is ready to accept Russia’s interpretation of Minsk II. Instead of becoming a tool to control Ukraine, the Donbas region is becoming another “frozen conflict,” a Russian-controlled enclave, similar to Transnistria. Under economic stress because of the fall of oil prices and Western sanctions, and without substantial support from other important players (such as China), the Kremlin seems to be ready to give up on the goal of reintegrating Ukraine, at least for the moment. So it would be safe to say that there are differing interpretations of what’s happening in Ukraine. And these interpretations matter greatly. If you agree with Diehl, then a robust response in Syria is absolutely necessary, because Putin now thinks that he can do whatever he wants with his military without fear of retaliation. If you agree with Speck and others, then Putin’s Syria gambit looks like a much more desperate gamble. So who lost Ukraine? The answer depends crucially on your starting point.  If you ask who lost Ukraine compared to the status quo in, say, February 2014 after Viktor Yanukovych fled the scene, then you’d have to answer the West. Ukraine has gone from being a triumphal story of social movements translating into a pro-Western government in Kiev to a country dismembered by Russia. Moscow now controls the Crimea and will not be returning it. Russian forces and Russian proxies control a slice of eastern Ukraine, and that conflict looks like it’s frozen — and that’s the best-case outcome for the Ukrainian government. In essence, Vladimir Putin has been able to violate Westphalian sovereignty with impunity on the European continent, and has more territory as a result. Putin retains the option of heating up the frozen conflict whenever he wants. There is no way to paint this as a victory for the West or Western norms.    Russian President Vladimir Putin took a dive in a submersible off Crimea's coast, annexed by Moscow last year. (Reuters)   On the other hand, if you ask who lost Ukraine compared to the status quo in, say, September 2013, then you’d have to answer Russia. It’s worth stressing that at that point, Russia had a perfectly pliant ally governing its most strategically vital neighbor. Moscow was about to pull off a feat of economic statecraft in forcing Ukraine to abandon the European Union’s Eastern Partnership program. Ukraine looked set to join Putin’s Eurasian Economic Union. And now, after a significant loss of Russian blood and treasure, Moscow can claim … control over the least economically viable portions of Ukraine. No matter how much Russia ratchets up the violence, it will not be able to peaceably hold much more Ukrainian territory. I wrote the following in July: The hard truth remains that Putin’s strategic position now is weaker than it was five years ago. Now he has to deal with a weaker domestic economy, a hostile Ukrainian government that will create more Russian casualties, and a NATO that’s gearing up to more credibly defend Eastern Europe. Putin has responded in numerous ways, none of them terribly effective. Sure, he’s embraced the east — but China will be happy to exploit this opportunity for commercial gains and not much else. And for all the talk about Russia’s efforts to propagandize its way into the hearts and minds of some European populations, the fact remains that European leaders are likely to be more resolute in an escalating crisis, and the European Union is still way more powerful on the continent than Russia. The only way in which Putin’s strategy has worked is in bolstering his own domestic standing. Nothing has changed in Putin’s favor in the months since. Wait, actually, that’s not true, because the price of Russia’s primary exports has fallen further, and it looks like China is going to screw Russia over even more on the gas deals. So who lost Ukraine? On the one hand, congratulations, you’re all losers, especially the Ukrainians!! But from a truly realpolitik perspective, however, Russia is the biggest loser. This fact is worth keeping in mind when everyone starts freaking out about Russia’s military presence in Syria. This is not to say that such a presence is a good thing for anyone. It’s not. Rather, it would be a mistake to infer that Russia’s use of military statecraft amounts to a permanent expansion of Russian influence. As with Ukraine, Russia’s strategic position in the Middle East was stronger five years ago than it is today.  Or, to sum it up in a tweet:   Russia has a history of overextending itself into catastrophic consequences. Wait for it. https://t.co/hbYQZm06W4 — Brett Friedman (@BA_Friedman) September 14, 2015 ","articleSrc":"WP","articleHeader":"Who lost Ukraine?"}

Why is Vladimir Putin pouring troops and weaponry into Syria? After all, as Secretary of State John Kerry has thrice told his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, it is only making things worse. But worse for whom? For the additional thousands of civilians who will die or flee as a result of the inevitably intensified fighting. True, and I’m sure Lavrov is as moved by their plight as by the 8,000 killed in Russia’s splendid little Ukrainian adventure.  Charles Krauthammer writes a weekly political column that runs on Fridays. View Archive   Facebook RSS   Kerry and Obama are serially surprised because they cannot fathom the hard men in the Kremlin. Yet Putin’s objectives in Syria are blindingly obvious: 1. To assert Russia’s influence in the Middle East and make it the dominant outside power. Putin’s highest ambition is to avenge and reverse Russia’s humiliating loss of superpower status a quarter-century ago. Understanding this does not come easily to an American president who for seven years has been assiduously curating America’s decline abroad. 2. To sustain Russia’s major and long-standing Arab ally. Ever since Anwar Sadat kicked the Soviets out of Egypt in 1972, Syria’s Assads have been Russia’s principal asset in the Middle East. 3. To expand the reach of Russia’s own military. It has a naval base at Tartus, its only such outside of Russia. It has an airfield near Latakia, now being expanded with an infusion of battle tanks, armored personnel carriers, howitzers and housing for 1,500 — strongly suggesting ground forces to follow. 4. To push out the Americans. For Putin, geopolitics is a zero-sum game: Russia up, America down. He is demonstrating whom you can rely on in this very tough neighborhood. Obama has given short shrift to the Kurds, shafted U.S. allies with the Iran deal and abandoned the Anbar Sunnis who helped us win the surge. Meanwhile, Putin risks putting Russian boots on the ground to rescue his Syrian allies. Obama says Bashar al-Assad has to go, draws a red line on chemical weapons — and does nothing. Russia acts on behalf of a desperate ally. Whom do you want in your corner? 5. To re-legitimize post-Crimea Russia by making it indispensable in Syria. It’s a neat two-cushion shot. At the United Nations next week, Putin will offer Russia as a core member of a new anti-Islamic State coalition. Obama’s Potemkin war — with its phantom local troops (our $500 million training program has yielded five fighters so far) and flaccid air campaign — is flailing badly. What Putin is proposing is that Russia, Iran and Hezbollah spearhead the anti-jihadist fight.  Putin’s offer is clear: Stop fighting Assad, accept Russia as a major player and acquiesce to a Russia-Iran-Hezbollah regional hegemony — and we will lead the drive against the Islamic State from in front. And there is a bonus. The cleverest part of the Putin gambit is its unstated cure for Europe’s refugee crisis. Wracked by guilt and fear, the Europeans have no idea what to do. Putin offers a way out: No war, no refugees. Stop the Syrian civil war and not only do they stop flooding into Europe, those already there go back home to Syria.  Putin says, settle the war with my client in place — the Assad regime joined by a few “healthy” opposition forces — and I solve your refugee nightmare. You almost have to admire the cynicism. After all, what’s driving the refugees is the war and what’s driving the war is Iran and Russia. They provide the materiel, the funds and now, increasingly, the troops that fuel the fighting. The arsonist plays fireman. After all, most of the refugees are not fleeing the Islamic State. Its depravity is more ostentatious, but it is mostly visited upon minorities, Christian and Yazidi — and they have already been largely ethnically cleansed from Islamic State territory. The European detention camps are overflowing with Syrians fleeing Assad’s barbarism, especially his attacks on civilians, using artillery, chlorine gas and nail-filled barrel bombs. Putin to the rescue. As with the chemical weapons debacle, he steps in to save the day. If we acquiesce, Russia becomes an indispensable partner. It begins military and diplomatic coordination with us. (We’ve just agreed to negotiations over Russia’s Syrian buildup.) Its post-Ukraine isolation is lifted and, with Iran, it becomes the regional arbiter. In the end, the Putin strategy may not work, but it’s deadly serious and not at all obscure. The White House can stop scratching its collective head whenever another Condor transport unloads its tanks and marines at Latakia.

But that was in Donetsk, Ukraine, in 2014, where Borodai was prime minister of a ­pro-Russian separatist government. Now, he is back in his native Moscow and, as he tells it, back to his old day job as a public relations consultant. “When you are not on television, people start to forget what you look like,” he said, sinking into a cream-colored sofa in a tony Moscow restaurant for an interview. “And thank God for that. It was hard to go out on the street at first.” It is an unlikely, perhaps unbelievable, transformation for the most prominent Russian citizen in the war in Ukraine and the possible target of a Dutch investigation into the missile attack on a Malaysian airliner in July last year that killed 298 people. Borodai is not the only one of Russia’s self-proclaimed volunteer fighters to reappear here. As the conflict in east Ukraine has reached a stalemate, hundreds of volunteers have returned to Russia, and the early rebel leaders, many of them native Russians, have resumed comfortable, increasingly public lives in Moscow.   Wrapped in a tight Armani Exchange T-shirt and sporting a week’s stubble, Borodai said that he has not been in Donetsk since October and that his focus now is on reviving his consulting company. Business is bad. Several international companies, which he declined to name, severed their contracts when he was subjected to sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. Consulting “is an intimate business that requires a personal touch,” Borodai said, which was lacking while he was out of town. “People go to war, fulfill their duty, and then go back to peaceful, productive lives,” he said. “I don’t think this is especially interesting.”  [Female Ukrainian war hero facing 25 years in Russian jail]  Borodai’s respite from the spotlight may be short-lived, as Russia and the West are on a collision course over the Flight 17 investigation. The West has blamed rebel leaders, of whom Borodai was the most visible, and Russia for supplying them with sophisticated anti-aircraft weapons. Russia denies this, vetoed a United Nations tribunal and criticized the Dutch investigation as opaque. Indictments are expected near the end of the year. “I don’t have an answer. Let’s wait and see,” said Borodai when asked whether he would go to the Netherlands to face trial if accused. “This is a story that is long in the past for me, and I have done everything that I thought necessary and needed to support a full investigation.” Even if separatist leaders are formally accused, there are few signs Moscow would comply with the investigation or an extradition request. The return home In the meantime, the gang’s all here. You could have bumped into Marat Bashirov, the former prime minister of the separatist Luhansk People’s Republic, at the Moscow Economic Forum in March, where he gave a lecture titled “Risks, sanctions, lobbying.” Bashirov, a Moscow government relations consultant once employed by the oligarch Viktor Vekselberg’s holding company, was subjected to sanctions by the European Union in July 2014 along with Borodai. A snappy dresser, he remarked on a government airstrike on his headquarters in July last year in a dry post on Facebook: “It seems my Tom Ford suit has been killed. Now I will hold government sessions in camouflage.” Bashirov did not reply to requests for comment. In Moscow, he runs several government relations firms and chairs a committee on government relations at the Russia Managers Association, a spokesman there said. Last month, dressed in a navy blue suit, he gave a presentation to young entrepreneurs, one of whom tweeted: “Government is the regulator between producer and consumer. Marat Bashirov.” There is also Igor Girkin, the battle commander who once bragged that if not for his attacks on police stations in April last year, there would be no war in Ukraine. He now appears at lectures with far-right nationalists and has gone spectacularly off message, accusing Russia of abandoning the separatist republics in Ukraine that it helped to create. “The village crazy,” Borodai said with a smile. Borodai and Girkin are veterans of the ethnic conflicts that emerged with the fall of the Soviet Union. Borodai fought alongside ethnic Russians in Transnistria, Chechnya and ­Tajikistan during the 1990s. After each conflict, he returned to Moscow. “For them, this is just another war,” said Alexei Makarkin, a commentator on politics who studied alongside Girkin at a university in Moscow in the 1990s. “It isn’t something that feels extraordinary; they fought in the ’90s, after all.” Skeptics, and there are many, say that Borodai is either paid by Russia or is an employee of Russia’s security services. He denies both charges but said he passed information from ­Donetsk to Vladislav Surkov, the Kremlin apparatchik said to be overseeing Russian policy on Ukraine. Some events point to Russian control, such as the surprise arrivals of Borodai and Bashirov at a time of political chaos for the separatists. Others suggest miscommunication: When the rebels in May last year held referendums seen as a prelude to annexation, the Kremlin ­ignored them. It was an awkward moment for both sides.  [Russia holds its first International Army Games]  “I believe he acted carefully and competently,” Borodai said of President Vladimir Putin’s policy in Ukraine. “I can’t criticize his actions because in the end he has far more information than I do.” Russians returning from the war have diverse political views, and a small number are even openly hostile to Putin. Many more say they support Putin but believe he should have supported the volunteers more. “The government has hindered us more than anything,” said Vladimir Yefimov, a volunteer leader with a flowing beard who led 50 volunteers to war. “But I can say that because I am from here and ­allowed to criticize the government.” Some believe that Russia’s support for volunteers fighting in Ukraine could provoke instability or blowback. There have been worrying incidents: A former separatist sniper will soon stand trial in Moscow for the killing of two police officers last autumn. And the Federal Security Service has built a ­100-kilometer trench on the Ukrainian border because of concerns about weapons smugglers bringing automatic rifles and grenades from Ukraine. But there have not been clear signs yet that returned volunteers pose an urgent threat to Russia as either criminals or politicians. “First, there just are not that many of them,” Mark Galeotti, a security expert who visited Moscow this summer, said of returning volunteers. “I think that the Russians should be more concerned about the soldiers who are coming back.” The soldiers are Russian servicemen, some of whom have died under mysterious circumstances and are believed to have been fighting in Ukraine. Putin has shrugged off the accusations. Those who fought openly, calling themselves volunteers, are a more eccentric lot: nationalists or far-leftists, war veterans, thrill seekers and a few would-be philosophers. Sergei Kavtaradze, an aide to Borodai in Donetsk who was once labeled “the hipster with a machine gun,” returned to Russia last year and is now finishing a film adaptation of his doctoral dissertation. Titled “MilkForMadness,” it investigates “the archetypes of war,” Kavtaradze said, and the effects of war on its participants. “It makes people go crazy,” he said. In a trailer for the film, which Kavtaradze said was produced over the past five years, scenes of combat, torture and sex are cut together in quick succession under a heroic soundtrack. He said that he also filmed “a little bit” in Donetsk, when there was time. “Hopefully, it may be in some Western festivals next year,” Kavtaradze said of the film.    An earlier version erroneously cited Alexander Borodai, a former separatist leader in Ukraine, saying his guard tied up another rebel leader, Igor Girkin, as he was taken from Ukraine to Moscow. Borodai said Girkin was “escorted” back to Moscow, but was not bound    Read more:   Russia torches flowers to burn the Dutch   Today's coverage from Post correspondents around the world     ","articleSrc":"WP","articleHeader":"Former Russian rebels trade war in Ukraine for posh life in Moscow"}

He likened the idea of Novorossiya — the term invoked by Russian nationalists for breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine — to a realm in the fantasy universe of \"The Lord of the Rings,\" the popular trilogy written by the late J.R.R. Tolkien and eventually made into a Hollywood blockbuster. \"Ukraine existed, exists and will exist. But Novorossiya is the same myth as famous writer Tolkien's Mordor,\" Poroshenko said.  Mordor, for those who don't know, is the fell domain of Tolkien's great villain, Sauron. It's shrouded in darkness, guarded by towering black gates and populated by ranks of monstrous orcs and other, even nastier creatures. \"It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire, ash, and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume,\" intones one of Tolkien's characters in the film. \"There is evil there that does not sleep.\" Poroshenko's reference to Mordor doesn't come out of nowhere. As Bloomberg View's Leonid Bershidsky noted in an article last year, some in Kiev have peddled this image of a big, bad Russia resembling Mordor, while conjuring Ukraine as something like the pastoral, innocent Shire, full of well-meaning little Hobbits. The analogy got particular attention last December when a Russian company briefly contemplated installing a holographic \"Eye of Sauron\" — the fiery, all-seeing orb of the dread lord — atop a Moscow skyscraper. But Tolkien, the late British author and academic, rejected earlier interpretations of his text that connected the evil of the \"East\" with Stalinist Russia. \"The situation was conceived long before the Russian revolution. Such allegory is entirely foreign to my thought,\" he wrote in a letter to his publishers in 1961, cited by Bershidsky. \"The placing of Mordor in the east was due to simple narrative and geographical necessity, within my 'mythology.' \" Whatever the case, Russia — or at least a historical concept related to Russia — is hardly the only place on this planet that has been linked to Tolkien's Mordor. Here are other mooted spots. New Zealand    Tongariro National Park played the part of Mordor in the \"Lord of the Rings\" movies. (David Wall/Tourism New Zealand)  The films, directed by Peter Jackson, were shot in New Zealand. Mordor, in Jackson's rendering, was placed within the desolate landscape that surrounds the three great volcanoes of Tongariro National Park. In 2012, there were fears that one of the volcanoes in the park would erupt, belching fire and ash like Mordor's Mount Doom in Tolkien's tale.

The allegory of evil in Tolkien's universe had less to do with geography than a bending and twisting of nature. Mordor is all smoke and pollution, bellowing furnaces and blackening land. This was, in part, Tolkien's reaction to industrialization. And its mark could be seen especially in areas around the city of Birmingham, the home of Tolkien's parents. A recent exhibition in the nearby city of Wolverhampton linked images from Tolkien's sketchbooks to depictions of the Black Country, a region northwest of Birmingham once known for its coal mines, steel mills and stretches of industrial blight.

A year ago, the government introduced an embargo on food imports from Western countries. This embargo raised domestic food prices and contributed to a major decline in real incomes. But why isn’t it enough to confiscate Western food? Why burn it? For people raised in Soviet and post- Soviet Russia, the destruction of food is a taboo. In the past 100 years, Russia has experienced several famines. Even though there is no famine in modern Russia, more than 20 million people live in poverty. It would certainly make more sense to hand out food to them instead of destroying it. Can food burning be rationalized? Actually, for today’s Russian government, burning imports is a very rational move because it looks so horrible. The Kremlin wants to send a clear message: Yes, we can do things that you find irrational and unthinkable; do not mess with us. It is important to communicate this message inside and outside of Russia. To its supporters within Russia, the government says: The standoff with the West is a matter of principle, whatever the economic cost. (Such a statement is very timely — Russia’s second-quarter gross domestic product fell by 4.6 percent over the second quarter of last year.) The Kremlin also sends a signal of self-confidence to the domestic opposition: The government can afford doing unpopular things and still remain in control.  Outside of Russia, this is a signal of commitment to the course of confrontation. The West should understand that it cannot predict the Kremlin’s actions, and Western leaders should be afraid that Russia will do things that they would not dare do themselves. Coming from a nuclear power, this message sounds especially frightening.  But this is not the whole story. Food burning also demonstrates that the embargo’s main goal was not to reciprocate Western sanctions. If the goal were to punish European farmers, the government would confiscate the imports and hand them to the poor — this would hurt the European exporters as much as burning the food would. Food burning benefits only the Russian agricultural lobby. It reduces the supply of food in Russia, raising domestic prices and domestic producers’ profits. In this sense, food burning is not geopolitics; it is good old protectionism, fair and square. It shows that the government cares more about the agricultural lobby than Russian households. Russia’s anti-trade lobby has always been strong, but the World Trade Organization (WTO) accession in August 2012 has put it in a straitjacket. Initially, the Russian elites did not fully understand the WTO’s power. Allegedly, when selling the WTO accession to leftist members of parliament, a top government official said, “You should not worry about WTO rules; we will only pretend to stick to them while continuing protectionist policies.” After joining the WTO, the government introduced a “car recycling duty.” It was supposed to be paid only by foreign car manufacturers — to protect the domestic automotive sector after WTO accession commitments required a lowering of car import duties. However, Russia soon discovered that the WTO is a rule-based organization with teeth. An obvious violation of rules would result in retaliation — which other members immediately told Russia. Russia had to return to the equal playing field, and the government imposed the recycling duty on domestic car producers as well. With Russia’s annexation of Crimea, everything has changed. Having sold the cow, Russia has also sold her milk. Having violated the U.N. Charter when it did so, Russia can afford to break WTO rules. Once sanctions against Russia were introduced, politically connected businesses successfully lobbied for sector-specific and even company-specific subsidies and protectionist regulations — even if they violate WTO rules. These decisions show that the government’s priority is protecting the incomes of the lobbyists at the expense of Russian taxpayers and pensioners. If there are still any doubts as to whether the government cares more about the corrupt elites or about the ordinary Russians, the “purifying fire” has burned these doubts into the ground.

That would be unconscionable. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has overseen a ruthlessly effective effort to stop boats packed with migrants, many of them refugees, from reaching Australia’s shores. His policies have been inhumane, of dubious legality and strikingly at odds with the country’s tradition of welcoming people fleeing persecution and war. Since 2013, Australia has deployed its navy to turn back boats with migrants, including asylum seekers, before they could get close to its shores. Military personnel force vessels carrying people from Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Eritrea and other conflict-roiled nations toward Indonesia, where most of the journeys begin. A boat captain recently reported that Australian authorities paid him $30,000 to turn back. If true, that account, which the Australian government has not disputed, would represent a violation of international laws designed to prevent human smuggling and protect asylum seekers. Those who have not been turned back are held at detention centers run by private contractors on nearby islands, including the tiny nation of Nauru. A report this week by an Australian Senate committee portrayed the Nauru center as a purgatory where children are sexually abused, guards give detainees marijuana in exchange for sex and some asylum seekers are so desperate that they stitch their lips shut in an act of protest. Instead of stopping the abuses, the Australian government has sought to hide them from the world. The Border Force Act, which took effect July 1, makes it a crime punishable by a two-year prison sentence for employees at detention camps to discuss the conditions there publicly. Australia and Nauru, which depends heavily on Australian foreign aid, have gone to great lengths to keep international journalists from gaining access to the detention center, in which more than 2,200 people have been held since 2012. Last year, Nauru raised the fee it charges for journalists’ visas from $200 to roughly $8,000; applicants who are turned down are not given refunds. Scores of people who have worked at the camp have become whistle-blowers. More than 40, including medical personnel and social workers, wrote a public letter to senior government officials in July saying they would rather risk arrest than stay quiet. “If we witness child abuse in Australia we are legally obliged to report it to child protection authorities,” they wrote. “If we witness child abuse in detention centers, we can go to prison for attempting to advocate for them effectively.” European officials have traveled to Australia on fact-finding missions recently. Mr. Abbott, who argues that aggressively intercepting the boats saves lives, has urged European governments to follow his model, and some European leaders seem so inclined. “The Australian model may seem attractive to politicians,” said Leonard Doyle, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration. “Politicians love fences, but what fences do is create a market for smugglers and major humanitarian problems.” The world’s war zones are all but certain to continue to churn out an extraordinary number of refugees and economic migrants in the years ahead. Those people understandably will head to the most prosperous nations, hoping to rebuild their lives. It is inexcusable that some find themselves today in situations that are more hopeless and degrading than the ones that prompted them to flee."}

It is a plan Europe simply must adopt if it is to get a handle on the crisis and remain true to its history and values. There is no question that this calamity is without a simple solution. About half a million people have already entered Europe this year and hundreds of thousands more are poised to follow from the Middle East and North Africa. But Europe’s disarray and incompetence in the face of the flood of refugees has only made matters worse, wreaking havoc in front-line countries like Greece, Italy and Hungary and chaos all along the routes taken by refugees trying to reach a safe haven. Many Europeans have reacted with individual compassion, and Germany and Sweden have been exemplary in accepting large numbers of refugees. But the shocking image of a Hungarian camerawoman deliberately tripping a man fleeing from the police has become the icon of a nasty backlash in many parts of Europe against the mass migration, with refugee camps set ablaze and xenophobic demagogues railing against an “Islamic invasion.” However great the crisis, it should not have come to this. It should not have come as a surprise: Four million Syrians fleeing the civil war in their country have long overwhelmed refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, while boatloads of miserable people have been risking death to cross the Mediterranean for years. It was certainly within the ability of a rich and united Europe to manage. Mr. Juncker’s proposal is hardly a panacea, and would still leave hundreds of thousands of refugees in Europe seeking a place to go. But it represents an approach the E.U. should have adopted from the very outset. As Mr. Juncker noted, the 160,000 represents a mere 0.11 percent of the the union’s total population, and the newcomers could be the infusion of youth and energy that an aging Europe needs. Adopting this relatively modest plan of action is essential not only for self-evident humanitarian reasons, but also to reverse the threat to the very survival of the E.U. and its system of open borders. That is a point Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has emerged as the strongest European voice for united and compassionate action, has repeatedly stressed. Resistance to Mr. Juncker’s proposal is certain. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, has shamefully argued for keeping out the mainly Muslim refugees “to keep Europe Christian,” and several other nations have resisted any quotas. Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain has declared he will not participate in Mr. Juncker’s plan, and will accept only 20,000 Syrians over the next five years, who will come directly from Middle Eastern camps. When European interior ministers gather on Monday, they should recall that many of their own people were refugees not long ago, and that their union was based on values that evolved through their own history of suffering and flight. They must understand that beyond simply sharing a burden they are called on to do what conscience dictates. Adopting the Juncker plan should be the long-overdue start of a far wider European effort to address the crisis, with safer venues and common rules for asylum seekers and refugees, better search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean and an equitable system of relocation. As Europe gets its act together, so should the United States. President Obama indicated Thursday that the United States would take in at least 10,000 Syrian refugees. But the White House also emphasized that the administration would not expedite the review process for refugees, which can take two years to complete. That paltry number sets a terrible example for other nations asked to step up to this urgent challenge."}

The chancellor, whose summer was interrupted by an urgent effort to secure a third financial aid package for Greece, has found herself under fire for what political opponents and even some members of her coalition government have called foot-dragging in dealing with the migration crisis. About 800,000 people are expected to seek asylum in Germany this year, but overcrowded reception centers, a lack of personnel and outbreaks of far-right hatred against some of the new arrivals have left Germany, and some of its European partners, struggling in recent months to cope with the influx. The discovery last week of the bodies of 71 people who were believed to have been bound for the German border in a truck abandoned alongside a highway in Austria has pushed the issue to the fore of the European agenda. At a regular summer news conference in Berlin on Monday, Ms. Merkel encouraged Germans and other Europeans to recall the principles of justice and human rights that were at the heart of the response to the crisis. “If Europe fails on the question of refugees, if this close link with universal civil rights is broken, then it won’t be the Europe we wished for,” Ms. Merkel said, urging the 27 other countries in the bloc to take more responsibility in offering asylum to refugees. “Europe as a whole must move,” Ms. Merkel said, warning that failing to do so would weaken the agreements that had led to the elimination of border controls and an increase in freedom of movement through much of the Continent over the past 20 years, under what is known as the Schengen agreement. “If we don’t succeed in fairly distributing refugees then of course the Schengen question will be on the agenda for many,” Ms. Merkel said. With increasing numbers hoping to come to Germany, lured by the stability and job prospects offered by Europe’s largest economy, Ms. Merkel urged Germans to look at the situation in the context of the country’s history. “The world sees Germany as a country of hope and opportunity, that was not always the case,” Ms. Merkel said, reminding Germans that they could be proud of a postwar country based on the principles of dignity, human rights and the right to political asylum. Ms. Merkel said her government was planning measures in the coming months aimed at coordinating efforts between communities, states and the federal government, which each carry different responsibilities in welcoming, processing and integrating those who are granted the right to remain in the country as refugees. Ms. Merkel praised the thousands of Germans who had opened their homes and pocketbooks to the newcomers and who had donated their time. “There is no tolerance for those who question the dignity of other people,” she said, echoing comments she made last week at a reception center for asylum seekers in the eastern German city of Heidenau that had been the site of violent protests. Germany needs to be able to process applications more swiftly, and language and elementary-school teachers are needed to help families adapt — in Berlin alone, 400 new classes of students will be starting the new school year, the chancellor said. Germany must also overcome logistical hurdles like the cumbersome bureaucracy needed to construct shelters at a rapid enough pace, she said, pointing out the country lacks a fire safety ordinance for tents. Ms. Merkel said her government would address issues like those in a law that she hoped would be passed before the end of the year. “German thoroughness is super, but right now what we need is German flexibility,” Ms. Merkel said, recalling the government’s swift reaction to the global banking crisis of 2008, the ability to respond to natural disasters and, 25 years ago, the reunification of East and West Germany."}

The asylum seekers were coping with conflicting messages from Europe, ranging from warm welcomes in some places to a series of new constraints on their ability to get where they want to go: Hungary mobilized its army on the border with Serbia as a prelude to a possible increased role for the military in its response; Austria halted rail service across the border with Hungary under the strain of the migration influx; and a leading far-right politician in the Netherlands warned of an “Islamic invasion.” The sometimes wrenching changes from day to day have only underscored the lack of unity throughout Europe, particularly after Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, on Wednesday called for the member nations to put aside their differences and commit to a series of unified responses to the Continent’s worst humanitarian crisis in decades. At least 7,000 migrants, including parents with small children, passed the border between Greece and Macedonia on Thursday, confronting heavy rainfall, muddy roads and immense piles of garbage as Macedonia, a poor Balkan country and a candidate to join the European Union, announced that it might follow Hungary’s example and build a fence to keep migrants out. Jasmin Redzepi, president of Legis, an organization that has been helping migrants and refugees passing through the country, said the situation was “very serious” since only about 700 people could be housed temporarily in tents at the main registration center near the border. Denmark, which had temporarily closed a highway running north from the German border to try to contain migrants seeking to travel to Sweden and other countries, said on Thursday that it would not impede their progress. The about-face highlighted confusion over how to apply European Union rules, which require migrants to register or seek asylum in the country of their arrival. Denmark has recently lowered benefits to migrants, and many of those traveling through the country do not want to remain there. Among the toughest responses to the crisis has been Hungary’s, where the army on Thursday conducted exercises near the Serbian border, which could be preparation for a more active role as thousands continued to pour into the country overnight. The involvement of the army in policing the border, where a 110-mile fence with razor wire was being built to keep migrants out, is subject to the approval of Parliament this month. The number of migrants in the area has shown no sign of abating, and Hungarian military officials have said the army will help secure the country’s borders. More than 3,000 migrants crossed the border into Austria from Hungary overnight, and another 3,000 or so were expected to arrive in the area on Thursday, the police and Red Cross officials at the border said. Rail service was halted between the two countries on Thursday, Reuters reported, because Austria could not handle the number of migrants crossing the border. It was not clear when service would resume. The Hungarian police detained 3,321 people for crossing the border illegally on Wednesday, the highest daily figure so far this year, according to data published by the police. Mr. Juncker on Wednesday issued an impassioned call for countries across the 28-nation bloc to overcome divisions, and he invoked Europe’s historical imperative not to turn its back on the huge number of migrants streaming in. Mr. Juncker proposed that the European Union accept and distribute 160,000 migrants across its member nations, and he implored Europeans not to forget that their ancestors had also fled hardship, poverty and famine. Mr. Juncker’s plea appeared to have been embraced by Prime Minister Ewa Kopacz of Poland, who was quoted by Reuters as saying that she had heard and understood his message. Responding to comments by the opposition that Poland should not heed the European Union’s calls, she said, “Calls for Polish solidarity is no blackmail.” “Acting jointly and efficiently in the E.U. is in our interest,” Ms. Kopacz said. “Let’s be decent. President Juncker has reminded us that once, we were also refugees.” Yet in Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel has been pushing for mandatory quotas, even some supporters of quotas acknowledged that they were unlikely to be accepted across the bloc. Mr. Juncker’s “latest plan is definitely a move in the right direction,” the left-leaning newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung said in an editorial on Thursday. “He will surely know, however, that the plan is very unlikely to be implemented. The resistance of individual countries may take it apart — and with it the entire European project.” Such resistance was evident in Hungary, where Janos Lazar, the prime minister’s chief of staff, reiterated the country’s rejection of a quota system. “The government won’t accept the diktat, which several European powers are trying to force onto Hungary,” he said. In Netherlands, the far-right politician Geert Wilders was even more emphatic, calling the influx of migrants to Europe an “Islamic invasion” in a parliamentary debate on Thursday, Reuters reported, and underlining that country’s struggle over how to respond to the crisis. “Masses of young men in their 20s with beards singing ‘Allahu akbar’ across Europe,” he was quoted as saying by the news agency. “It’s an invasion that threatens our prosperity, our security, our culture and identity.” The Dutch government has indicated a willingness to accept more migrants if the quota system is embraced across the bloc. But, as in many European countries, there has been a fierce debate in the Netherlands about the challenges of immigration, and Mr. Wilders and his Party for Freedom have been citing the crisis to argue that the country risks being overcome by Muslim migrants who do not subscribe to the Netherlands’ vaunted liberal values. Advocates for migrants argued that the commission’s proposals, however well intentioned, were insufficient to address a growing challenge. The plan amounted to small steps, Iverna McGowan, the acting director of the European Institutions Office at Amnesty International, said on Wednesday, adding that more resources were needed to handle the influx in a humane way. Ms. McGowan suggested that the commission was misguided in focusing its resources on returning migrants to so-called safe countries — like Albania, Serbia and Turkey that it says are free of persecution, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, indiscriminate violence and armed conflict. Such a policy might result in people who would otherwise qualify for asylum being sent back to persecution, she said. Austria and Germany threw open their borders over the weekend, in what was described as a one-time gesture for migrants. So far, however, there has been no attempt to halt the flow of arrivals. Almost all of the migrants who have come from Hungary in recent days have opted to continue on to Germany rather than apply for asylum in Austria. But a backlash is brewing among far-right anti-immigrant groups in Germany, and it remains unclear how far the country’s capacity can be stretched. Germany expects more than 800,000 asylum seekers to arrive this year, and more than half that number are already there, according to Sigmar Gabriel, the country’s vice chancellor. “Germany registered 450,000 refugees, including 105,000 in August and 73,000 in the first eight days of September,” Mr. Gabriel told Parliament in Berlin. “There may be more than 100,000 in September.”"}

Some 13,015 refugees arrived in Munich on Saturday alone, and at least 1,400 are expected Sunday to reach the southern German city -- the end of their exhausting and often perilous journey through Hungary and Austria. Germany has become the destination of choice for many refugees, particularly for Syrians after Chancellor Angela Merkel decided to relax asylum rules for citizens of the war-torn country. Migrants arrive at the railway station in Munich, southern Germany, on September 12, 2015 ©Philipp Guelland (AFP/File) However, with some 450,000 people arriving in Europe's biggest economy so far this year, local authorities are buckling under the sudden surge. \"Given the numbers from yesterday, it is very clear that we have reached the upper limit of our capacity,\" said a Munich police spokesman. Federal transport minister Alexander Dobrindt also weighed in, saying \"effective measures are necessary now to stop the influx\". \"That includes help for countries from where refugees are fleeing and also includes an effective control of our own borders which also no longer works given the EU's complete failure to protect its external borders,\" he said in a statement. Dobrindt was essentially referring to the border between Turkey and Greece, where many migrants have crossed. Merkel herself had called Saturday on Athens, while facing its own deep economic crisis, to make more effort to protect the EU's external borders. European Union home affairs ministers will hold emergency talks on Monday as \"the situation of migration phenomena outside and inside the European Union has recently taken unprecedented proportions\", the Luxembourg presidency. The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation is also due to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis on Sunday. While Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey are housing millions of refugees, many of the wealthy Gulf states are facing increasing scrutiny over their apparent reluctance to take in migrants.  - 'Brink of collapse?' -  In Munich, order had largely returned to the city's main railway station on Sunday even though the federal interior ministry said 13,015 people arrived over the past day. But Germany's local authorities say they are at the end of their tether. The president of the Upper Bavaria region, Christoph Hillenbrand, said he did not know \"how we can cope\", according to the Bild am Sonntag tabloid which headline its article \"Munich on the brink of collapse\". Bavarian public television BR said the city \"came very close to a humanitarian disaster\", although the authorities finally managed to limit the numbers of people sleeping on mattresses on the floor to just a few dozens, rather than the hundreds as earlier feared. The authorities are mulling over whether to open up the Olympiahalle -- a stadium used for the 1972 Olympics and which today serves as a concert hall or sports arena -- as a temporary shelter for the refugees.  - European divisions -  As the continent scrambles to respond to the biggest movement of people since World War II, sharp divisions have emerged between the European Union's 28 member states -- both among governments and on the ground. While Germany and France are backing proposals to help \"frontline\" states Italy, Greece and Hungary buckling under the strain, European Commission proposals for sharing 160,000 of the new arrivals in a quota scheme are facing resistance from eastern members. Hungary, which reported a new record in migrant arrivals -- 4,330 on Saturday -- was working around the clock to finish a controversial anti-migrant fence along its southern border with Serbia. Budapest has recorded some 180,000 people entering illegally this year and has passed a raft of tough new laws that will take effect on Tuesday, meaning anyone crossing the border illegally can be deported or even jailed. \"These migrants are not coming our way from war zones but from camps in Syria's neighbours... So these people are not fleeing danger and don't need to be scared for their lives,\" hardline Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban told Germany's Bild daily. He said Merkel's decision to relax asylum laws had caused \"chaos\" and accused European leaders of \"living in a dream world\". The idea that quotas would work is an \"illusion,\" he said. \"The influx is endless: from Pakistan, Bangladesh, Mali, Ethiopia, Nigeria. If they are all going to come here, then Europe is going to go under.\" Austria's chancellor however slammed its neighbour, comparing Orban's treatment of migrants to Nazi-era cruelty. \"Piling refugees on trains in the hopes that they go far far away brings back memories of the darkest period of our continent,\" Werner Faymann told German weekly Der Spiegel. The division was also seen on the ground, with tens of thousands marching through London on Saturday waving placards saying \"Refugee lives matter\", while in Eastern European capitals, protesters called for refugees to \"go home\". The International Organization for Migration said Friday that more than 430,000 people have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe this year, with 2,748 dying en route or going missing.

German proposals for compulsory quotas within the Europe Union were rebuffed by nations in the east on Friday, with Slovakia's foreign minister saying: \"Migrants don't want to stay\" there. Meanwhile, public pressure on politicians was growing, with tens of thousands of people expected to take part in a Europe-wide \"day of action\" in solidarity with refugees on Saturday. A migrant sits alone as hundreds wait for buses near Nickelsdorf, Austria on the border between Hungary and Austria on September 11, 2015 ©Joe Klamar (AFP) Pressing his Czech, Hungarian, Polish and Slovakian counterparts at a meeting in Prague, Germany's foreign minister warned the influx of hundreds of thousands of migrants could be \"the biggest challenge for the EU in its history\". \"If we are united in describing the situation as such, we should be united that such a challenge is not manageable for a single country,\" Frank-Walter Steinmeier said, calling for \"European solidarity\". The International Organization for Migration said over 430,000 migrants and refugees had crossed the Mediterranean to Europe so far in 2015, with 2,748 dying or going missing en route. Germany has taken the lion's share, admitting 450,000 refugees so far this year, most of them fleeing violence in the Middle East -- particularly Syria -- and Asia. But Steinmeier's appeal for EU members to accept proposals to share around 160,000 migrants fell on deaf ears among eastern nations. Slovak Foreign Minister Miroslav Lajcak said he wanted a solution \"that is not imposed\" but \"made jointly\". \"Migrants don't want to stay in Slovakia,\" he added bluntly. Denmark's right-wing government also said it would not take part in the quota scheme.  - 'Not fleeing danger' -  With criticism growing of Hungary's treatment of thousands of people passing through on their way to northern Europe, premier Viktor Orban said he wanted 3.0 billion euros ($3.4 billion) handed to Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, the first ports of call for Syrians trying to escape conflict. \"If it takes more money, we will increase aid until the refugee flows are drying up,\" Orban told Germany's Bild newspaper. \"These migrants do not come from war zones but from camps (in these border countries), where they were safe. \"They are not fleeing danger -- they have already fled and should not fear for their lives.\" They come to Europe not \"because they seek safety but because they want a better life than in a camp. They want a German life, perhaps a Swedish life\". \"But it's a fact: there is no fundamental right to a better life, only a right to security and human dignity,\" he said. Orban's comments come as Hungary builds a fence on the Serbian border to keep migrants out and has adopted tough new laws that will make it a crime to cross the border illegally from next week. \"From September 15, the rules are changing in Hungary, if you cross the border illegally, you will be immediately arrested by the authorities,\" Orban warned Friday. Further concerns about Hungary were raised Friday by video footage showing migrants inside a holding camp being fed -- in the words of one volunteer -- \"like animals in a pen\". Orban insisted Friday that his country was just trying to apply European rules in seeking to register the new arrivals, pinning the blame on fellow EU member Greece for waving migrants through for onward travel north. \"Just because Greece is not keeping to the common (Schengen) agreement does not authorise Hungary to give up on the Schengen rules as well,\" he said in Budapest.  - Selling boats to migrants -  EU lawmakers have called for an international conference on migration, together with the United States, United Nations and Arab countries. Facing criticism that his government has been too slow to help, US President Barack Obama pledged to admit at least 10,000 Syrian refugees over a year starting October 1. Underscoring the scale of the crisis, some 7,600 migrants entered Macedonia in just 12 hours overnight, according to a UN official, with more buses on their way from Greece. From Macedonia, the migrant route cuts through Serbia into Hungary and from there veers west into Austria, from where most of the arrivals continue on to Germany and Sweden. Germany has placed 4,000 troops on standby for this weekend alone to cope with the influx. From the smugglers who pack migrants into leaky boats, to taxi drivers who charge exorbitant sums to ferry them across land, some people have sought to profit from the migrants' plight. The French government on Friday suspended an honorary consul in the Turkish resort of Bodrum after she was secretly filmed selling rubber dinghies and life jackets to desperate refugees.

The United Nations called for the swift creation of\nlarge-scale reception centres in frontline states such as\nHungary and Greece, and one U.N. agency warned that millions\nmore refugees could arrive in Europe if Syria's civil war\ncontinues to rage. Many of the tens of thousands of refugees now trekking from\nGreece via the Balkans and Hungary towards western Europe are\nfleeing the Syrian war in search of sanctuary, above all in more\nwelcoming and generous countries such as Germany and Sweden. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said his\ncountry, which expects to take in 800,000 asylum seekers this\nyear alone, had finite resources and urged other European\ncountries to do much more to share the burden. He said Germany expected to receive another 40,000 migrants\nthis weekend. And as politicians from the left and right accused\nChancellor Angela Merkel's government of losing control of the\nrefugee situation, the defence ministry put 4,000 troops on\nstandby to help with the influx. Citing security concerns, Austria partially shut a highway\nlinking Vienna and Hungary on Friday. Some 8,000 people had\ncrossed the border on Thursday and a further 4,500 arrived\novernight, Austrian police said. The rail link to Hungary also\nremains shut due to \"massive overburdening\" by the migrants. Hungary is racing to construct a fence along its border with\nSerbia by early October to help stem the tide. It also plans to\nimplement much tougher immigration rules from next week. Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a fiery populist who has framed\nthe crisis as a battle to preserve Europe's prosperity and\n\"Christian identity\", angrily criticised the behaviour of the\nmostly Muslim migrants who have been filling up central Budapest\nand disrupting traffic along roads running westward to Austria. \"They seized railway stations, rejected giving fingerprints,\nfailed to cooperate and are unwilling to go to places where they\nwould get food, water, accommodation and medical care ... They\nrebelled against Hungarian legal order,\" Orban told reporters. \"From the 15th, Hungarian authorities will not forgive\nillegal border crossings,\" he said. More than 170,000 migrants have crossed into Hungary from\nnon-EU Serbia so far this year. Many try to avoid being\nregistered in Hungary for fear of being stranded there or\nreturned to the country later in their journey across Europe.  MILLIONS MORE COULD COME In Geneva, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)\nsaid it was sending pre-fabricated housing units to provide\ntemporary overnight shelter for 300 families in Hungary but also\nexpressed concern over Budapest's tough approach, including the\npossible deployment of troops to tackle the crisis. \"Obviously we expect authorities to respect rights of\nrefugees whether they are the police or army,\" said UNHCR\nspokesman William Spindler. Syria's four-year civil war has so far displaced almost\neight million people, said Peter Salama of UNICEF, the U.N.\nchildrens' agency, adding: \"There could be millions and millions\nmore refugees leaving Syria and ultimately (going) to the\nEuropean Union and beyond.\" So far this year, a record 433,000 refugees and migrants\nhave crossed the Mediterranean to Europe, more than double the\ntotal for all of 2014, the International Organization for\nMigration (IOM) said on Friday. The European Commission, backed by Germany and France, wants\nEU member states to accept mandatory quotas to share out some\n160,000 refugees but the plan faces stiff resistance in some\ncapitals. On Friday the UNHCR said the number of people\nrequiring relocation had now risen to 200,000. Speaking in Prague, Steinmeier said the EU needed a \"fair\nmechanism of redistribution of migrants (still coming)\". \"This challenge cannot be borne by one country. We have to\ninvoke European solidarity,\" he told a joint news conference\nwith the foreign ministers of the Czech Republic, Slovakia,\nHungary and Poland - countries opposed to the EU's proposal for\nmandatory quotas. Germany has come under fire from Orban and other east\nEuropean leaders for opening its door to Syrian asylum seekers,\nsaying such generosity will only encourage many more to come. Denmark, which like Britain has opted out of EU rules on\njustice and home affairs, said on Friday it would not take part\nin the Commission's relocation scheme. Earlier this week, Denmark shut off some traffic with\nGermany to curb refugees trying to reach Sweden, which remains\nmuch more welcoming than other Scandinavian countries, but later\nallowed them to travel through. Finland said it would accept its two percent share of asylum\nseekers under the Commission plan but said it remained opposed\nto mandatory quotas and would cut benefits for refugees. EU interior ministers are due to discuss the Commission\nproposals on Monday. If they fail to reach a deal on tackling\nthe crisis, European Council chief Donald Tusk said on Friday he\nwould call an extraordinary summit of EU leaders this month.\n\n (Additional reporting by Reuters bureaux in Berlin, Prague,\nVienna, Helsinki, Copenhagen; Writing by Gareth Jones; Editing\nby Giles Elgood)"}

The United Nations refugee agency called for decent mass\nreception centres to be set up immediately in Greece, Italy and\nHungary, on the front lines of a huge influx of refugees being\nreceived in \"appalling conditions\". The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) welcomed a\nEuropean Union proposal to share out 160,000 refugees and an\noffer by Washington to take 10,000 Syrians over the next year,\nbut said \"the United States could and should do much more\". The Geneva-based International Organization for Migration\nsaid a record 432,761 refugees and migrants were now estimated\nto have made the perilous journey across the Mediterranean to\nEurope so far this year, while 2,748 have drowned. The IOM said an estimated 309,356 people had arrived by sea\nin Greece as of Sept. 10, with another 121,139 arriving in\nItaly, 2,166 in Spain and 100 in Malta. This was a record and compared with 197,940 people who\narrived by sea in those four European countries in all of 2014,\nIOM spokesman Daniel Szabo told Reuters. The UNHCR is sending prefabricated housing units to provide\ntemporary overnight shelter for 300 families in Hungary, a\ncountry that is building a 175-km (110-mile) fence along its\nsouthern border with Serbia to stem the flow of people trekking\nnorth, many aiming for Germany. \"We are stepping up operations in Europe, including\nHungary,\" UNHCR spokesman William Spindler told a news briefing. Fifty pre-fab family homes have also arrived in the Greek\nisland of Lesbos, and a further 300 are being sent to nearby\nKos, while 50 have arrived in Macedonia, he said.  APPALLING CONDITIONS \"We are very concerned, we were the first to call attention\nto the appalling conditions in many of these places. They are\nslowing getting better, they are still far from meeting\ninternational standards,\" Spindler said. The UNHCR was \"closely following\" Hungary's use of the army\nto control the situation. \"Obviously we expect authorities to\nrespect rights of refugees whether they are the police or army\nor the civilian authorities,\" he said. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban warned that his police\nwould take tougher action from next week against migrants who he\nsaid had rebelled against authorities, seized railway stations\nand refused to be registered. UNHCR urged the EU to uphold national and international law\nin managing its borders, including by ensuring people are able\nto seek asylum from war and persecution. The UNHCR reiterated that the EU would need to relocate\n200,000 people from the frontline European countries such as\nGreece and Italy by the end of 2016, more than the 160,000\nmentioned in the EU plan. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on\nWednesday the EU would offer better protection for refugees but\nwould also improve its frontier defences and deport more illegal\nmigrants. About half of those crossing the Mediterranean are Syrians\nfleeing civil war, a figure \"expected to continue rising rapidly\nover the coming weeks and months\", the UNHCR said. Afghans, Eritreans, Nigerians and Somalis compose the other\nfour largest groups of nationalities in the human tide seeking\nEuropean shores, Spindler said. \"They will not be deterred by barbed wire or even taking\ndangerous sea voyages. The answer is to provide adequate legal\navenues for people to come to Europe in safety,\" Spindler said. (additional reporting by Tom Miles; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\nand Giles Elgood)"}

Austria closed the A4 motorway near Hungary for security\nreasons on Friday morning. A spokeswoman for the road operator\nASFINAG later said the eastbound lanes towards Hungary had\nreopened. Those walking had been picked up by buses and taxis. Around 8,000 people crossed the border into Austria on\nThursday and a further 4,500 had crossed since midnight, a\npolice spokesman said, adding that he expected the number of\ncrossings to match Thursday's. Austria cut its rail link to Hungary on Thursday, citing a\n\"massive overburdening\" of its capacity by migrants who continue\nto stream in from Hungary, many of them having fled the civil\nwar in Syria and marched through the Western Balkans. The train\nline will remain closed over the weekend, the rail company said. Since Germany and Austria said on Saturday that they would\nlet the wave of migrants enter their territory, tens of\nthousands of people have passed through Austria on their way to\nGermany. Only hundreds have requested asylum in Austria. \"Around 1,500 people have spent the night outdoors,\" the\npolice spokesman said. The authorities were trying to move\npeople \"to where they can continue their journey\", he added. The police handling the new arrivals at the Hungarian border\nare struggling to provide food and shelter for the migrants\nwhile arranging transport - largely on buses, though two special\ntrains were provided to shuttle people to Vienna. Hungary has transported tens of thousands of people to near\nthe Austrian border in the past week. They have then crossed the\nborder on foot. Others have entered Austria by train, but that\noption has been unavailable since Thursday's rail suspension. The Wiener Zeitung, a daily newspaper, said the crisis would\ncost Austria an extra 1 billion euros ($1.13 billion), citing an\nestimate by the Foreign Ministry, which deals with integration\nmatters. Kurier, another daily, said the figure was for 2016. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said it had not\ncompiled any such estimate.

With 3,321 registered entering from Serbia on Wednesday, the\nhighest daily total yet, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's chief of\nstaff said Hungary planned to introduce \"different rules of the\ngame\" from next week, with penalties for illegal entry,\naccelerated asylum procedures and possible expulsion back over\nthe border. He said the fence, in part being built by prisoners along\nthe 175-km (109-mile) border, would be completed sooner than\nplanned, by the beginning rather than the end of October. \"This 3.5-4-metre tall fence can be adequate to protect the\ncountry, especially if policemen are patrolling on the other\nside,\" Lazar told a weekly news conference. He said the government would meet next Tuesday to consider a\nproposal by the interior ministry to declare a \"state of crisis\ndue to mass migration\". Such a move would make it easier for\nauthorities to take control of public or municipal property, \nfor example to accommodate asylum seekers. A week later, parliament is expected to discuss sending the\narmy to the border. RAZOR WIRE Over 176,000 migrants and refugees, many of them fleeing the\nSyrian war, have been recorded entering Hungary over the\nEuropean Union's external border this year en route to the\nricher and more generous countries of western and northern\nEurope. Many more may have entered undetected, slipping through\nthe hands of over-stretched border police. Shrugging off the Cold War echoes of razor wire and\nwatchtowers along an east European border, Orban says the flow\nof migrants must stop, framing it as a battle for the prosperity\nand \"Christian identity\" of Europe. Hungary has declared Serbia, an impoverished former Yugoslav\nrepublic still years away from joining the European Union, to be\na safe country for refugees to seek asylum. That gives Budapest\nthe right to turn down any and all asylum requests from people\nentering across that border. The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) said this week the\ndesignation of Serbia as a so-called 'safe third country' was a\n\"disputed matter\" between Hungary and the agency. Lazar said that under the new rules, authorities would\nassess an asylum claim within 12 days in a fast-track procedure. He added that those arriving would receive support under the\nGeneva Convention and other international treaties, such as food\nand shelter, until their applications were processed. Lazar said Hungary planned to expand the capacity of\nreception centres in the next two weeks. The government plans to\nset up \"transit zones\" in the narrow border strip, which the\ngovernment has earlier compared to airport transit lounges in\nthat migrants held there would not be considered to have\nactually entered Hungarian territory. Rights groups say this\nwill strand people in a legal limbo. \n\n (Additional reporting by Sandor Peto; Writing by Matt Robinson;\nEditing by Mark Trevelyan)"}

Denmark, whose government took out adverts in Lebanese\nnewspapers to discourage migrants, emerged as the latest front\nin Europe's worst refugee crisis in decades as 3,200 people\nentered since Sunday, most trying to get to Sweden. Sweden expects to receive 80,000 refugees this year and has\nmore asylum seekers per capita than any other European nation\nthanks to a generous immigration policy allowing automatic\npermanent residency for Syrians. Allowing the resumption of traffic on ferries and the\nmotorway, Danish police said they had no power to detain\nrefugees. That means that thousands will now travel on to Sweden\nto seek asylum. \"There are no other possibilities than to let them go free,\nand consequently we cannot keep them from travelling where they\nwill,\" National Police Commissioner Jens Henrik Hojbjerg said. Centre right Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen held talks\nwith political leaders on Thursday in a second emergency meeting\nthis week but did not announce concrete action. \"Germany, Denmark and Sweden are in an extraordinary\nsituation and in that situation it is our task to live up to our\ninternational obligations,\" Rasmussen said afterwards. \"I don't think anyone, at least not me or the party leaders,\nas I have heard it, wants Danish police to use force in a very\nviolent way,\" he said. In Stockholm, Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said EU\nrules under which refugees should be registered in the country\nwhere they first arrive must be upheld and the decision to send\nrefugees on to Sweden was \"unfortunate\".  ACROSS THE BRIDGE When not temporarily detained, the refugees marched or took\ntrains to Copenhagen, which is a 35-minute ride from Malmo in\nSweden across the Oresund Bridge. Sweden's Migration Agency said 686 people had applied for\nasylum in Malmo since Sunday and more that 13,700 had arrived in\nthe country in the past five weeks. Both countries have a generous welfare system but Denmark\nhas recently tightened immigration and citizenship rules,\nincluding cutting benefits for refugees by up to half in a bid\nto discourage them from staying here. Sweden stands out in the Nordics as the exception. Denmark's\ntough refugee policy mirrors similar trends in Finland and\nNorway where right-wing anti-immigrant parties are on the\nascendant and part of coalition governments. Finland's centre-right government proposed increasing some\ntaxes to help cover the costs of migrants coming into the\ncountry. The Danish People's Party (DF), once on the political\nfringe, became the second largest parliamentary force after\nJune's election, gaining popularity largely due to its\nanti-immigration and eurosceptic rhetoric. Rasmussen's minority government depends on the party's\nsupport in parliament although his response to the crisis this\nweek has not been anywhere near as strong as the DF would like. \"We are a country based on law and order,\" DF leader\nKristian Thulesen Dahl told reporters. \"Citizens of other\ncountries must also be able to see that when they decide whether\nto use Denmark as a transit country in this asylum shopping\nwhich is going on ... We need control.\"  REFUGEES GIVEN LIFTS Refugees have been streaming in by two routes from Germany\n-- crossing by train overland into Jutland, the western part of\nDenmark that is connected to continental Europe, or by ferries\ncarrying trains that arrive in Lolland, an island linked by\nbridges to Zealand, where Copenhagen is located. At Rodbyhaven, the landing point for the ferries, around 50\npeople gathered, most volunteers with water bottles, as three\nboats arrived during the day, a Reuters reporter saw. No passport checks were made at Rodby on Thursday when\npassengers disembarked from ferries. Akhmed, a 32-year-old from Copenhagen, said that like others\nhe had come to give refugees a lift to Copenhagen. \"I could sit at home and count on other people doing it, but\nmy conscience couldn't stand for it,\" Akhmed said. One group of volunteers said they had been giving lifts to\nrefugees for 48 hours now, leaving them at Copenhagen's central\nstation rather than in Malmo, to avoid charges of human\ntrafficking. On Wednesday, authorities closed down the Jutland motorway\nafter 300 refugees began walking along it, and suspended train\nferries to Lolland. On Thursday the motorway reopened and most\ntrain ferry services resumed. The refugees are part of a wave of migrants sweeping north\nthrough Europe, many escaping the war in Syria. In Hungary, police said they detained a record 3,321\nmigrants on Wednesday and the interior ministry indicated it may\ndeclare a state of crisis next week. Austria suspended train services with Hungary at least for\nthe rest of Thursday because it cannot handle the volume of\nmigrants.\n\n (Additional reporting by Teis Jensen and Annabella Nielsen in\nCopenhagen, Daniel Dickson in Stockholm, Tom Heneghan in Berlin;\nWriting by Sabina Zawadzki; Editing by Alistair Scrutton and\nGiles Elgood)"}

Here are elements of existing EU plans, before an emergency\nmeeting of interior ministers on Monday:  BORDER FORCES Following the drowning of some 800 people on a single boat\noff Libya in April, the EU effectively reversed a sharp cutback\nin warships conducting search and rescue operations; since June,\na naval operation has been targeting people-smugglers. Plans to\nroam far into Libyan waters are on hold, seeking U.N. support. Some EU leaders have suggested a new European border force.\nGermany, France and Italy proposed an EU management system for\nthe external borders.  EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE The EU has paid for food, medicine, shelter and other needs\nfor migrants in countries which have asked for it. Italy and\nGreece will get nearly half of 2.4 billion euros ($2.7\nbillion)to help with the crisis over several years.  RELOCATION Juncker renewed and enlarged a proposal rejected by states\nin June for them to take in quotas of asylum seekers fixed by\nBrussels. He proposed relocating 160,000 people over two years,\nup from 40,000, and from Hungary (54,000) as well as from Greece\n(66,400) and Italy (39,400). For now, only Syrians, Eritreans\nand Iraqis qualify for relocation. Those who process people's claims to refugee status would\nreceive 6,000 euros per person, with Italy, Greece and Hungary\nreceiving 500 euros per person relocated. The total cost is put\nat 780 million euros. The Commission says once asylum seekers are relocated they\nhave no right to move within Europe's Schengen borderless zone. Juncker also proposed a permanent mechanism of relocation\nfor future crises, modifying the Dublin Regulation system by\nwhich claims are handled by the first EU state reached. Many governments, especially in the east, have opposed such\na scheme, calling it diktat from Brussels and saying it may\nattract migrants and disrupt societies unused to immigration. An\nattempt to secure voluntary pledges for 40,000 fell short and\nGermany and France, powerful players in the bloc, have thrown\ntheir combined weight behind a mandatory distribution. RESETTLEMENT Having rejected mandatory national quotas to take in 20,000\nrefugees direct from U.N. sites outside Europe, states pledged\nto take 22,000 in total in a two-year pilot scheme. It starts \nsoon and may expand, in cooperation with U.N. agencies who help\nsome 4 million Syrians as well as millions of other refugees. Britain, the bloc's second-biggest economy, is exempt from\nEU asylum policies but will has said it will take in 20,000\nSyrians direct from the Middle East over the next five years.  HOTSPOTS Accompanying the relocation of asylum-seekers from Italy and\nGreece, EU agencies will staff \"hotspots\" in Catania and Piraeus\nto identify and fingerprint migrants. Northern countries\ncomplain that failure to do so has broken EU rules and let many\ntravel over open EU borders to claim asylum in northern Europe. Hungary, which is setting up its own \"transit zones\" on the\nborder with non-EU Serbia which it has lined with fencing, has\nsaid it does not want hotspots - a key part of EU proposals to\ntoughen up and accelerate a process of distinguishing refugees\nfrom economic migrants and speed the removal of the latter.  DEPORTATION Economic migrants whose claims for refugee status fail will\nbe returned home more quickly. The EU is working with countries\nto ensure they take more people back. Juncker announced a shared\nEU list of seven \"safe\" states, notably the west Balkan states\nof Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Bosnia and Kosovo, as\nwell as Turkey. Their citizens are likely to face a \"fast-track\"\ndeportation if they claim asylum in the EU.  AID The EU will use its development aid budget to reduce poverty\nand other factors that drive migration, to encourage governments\nto curb people-smuggling gangs and dissuade their citizens from\nmigrating, and to cooperate with EU deportation procedures. The Commission has proposed creating a 1.8 billion euro\ntrust fund for Africa. There will be a summit with the African\nUnion in Malta on Nov. 11-12 and with western Balkan countries\nin the next few weeks.  FOREIGN MISSIONS Officials have steered away from suggestions the EU should\nset up facilities to process asylum applications in Africa or\nthe Middle East. Among other things, some say they could be\nvulnerable to attack and hard to manage. However, EU embassies\nare to have immigration officers to monitor migration trends. The EU is working with international agencies in Niger to\ninform migrants about to head for Libya of the risks they will\nrun and their low chances of being allowed to settle in Europe.  LEGAL MIGRATION The EU executive is reviewing schemes to issue EU visas to\nskilled workers as among the safe routes for immigration. It\nplans to bring new proposals in early 2016.\n($1 = 0.8977 euros)\n\n (Additional reporting by Francesco Guarascio and Philip\nBlenkinsop; Reporting by Alastair Macdonald; Editing by Alison\nWilliams)"}

A great migration has begun, and it could be with us for decades.  .tg-pullquote__global__group{zoom: 1;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:before, .tg-pullquote__global__group:after{content: \"\"; display: table;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:after{clear: both;}.tg-pullquote__inline{float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content{margin: 0 20px 10px 0px; font-size:18px; line-height:23px; font-family:georgia; width:260px; float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content--mobile{float: none; font-size: 18px; margin-left: 4.687%; margin-right: 4.687%; width: 90.626%;}.tg-pullquote__title{font-family:arial; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px; border-top:1px dotted #000000;}.tg-pullquote__quote{color:#007A8F; font-style:italic; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__attribution{color:#787878; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__source{}.tg-pullquote__source__link{color:#234B7B; outline:0; text-decoration:none;}.tg-pullquote__source__link:hover{border-bottom: 1px dotted #122842; color: #122842;}.tg-pullquote__share{float:right;}.tg-pullquote__share--icon{background-image:url(\"http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.png\"); background-image: url(\"http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.svg\"), none; width:26px; height:26px;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink{border-bottom:none;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink:hover{border-bottom:none !important;}.tg-pullquote__share--twitter{margin-right:5px;}.tg-pullquote__share--facebook{background-position: 26px 0;}\n\n\n    \"This Great Migration was not expected because, for years, politicians believed that there would be less of it as poor countries became richer.

Many are fleeing war, but many are fleeing poverty. The Royal Navy found a pregnant Nigerian woman who had paid $1,200 for the journey and a father from Faisalabad, an industrial city in Pakistan.  Under European rules, they would be judged by whether they were fleeing war or poverty – but the distinction seems moot. All were prepared to risk death to give their families a better life; seeking only the right to start at the very bottom.

Give aid, not shelter, ran the argument. “As the benefits of economic growth are spread in Mexico,” Bill Clinton once assured Americans, “there will be less illegal immigration because more Mexicans will be able to support their children by staying home.”  When José Manuel Barroso led the European Commission, he made the same argument: third world development will tackle the “root causes” of the problem.

Never has there been less violence: the Syrian conflict is an exception in a period of history where war has waned. It might not feel like it, but the world is more prosperous and peaceful than at any time in human history – yet the number of emigrants stands at a record high. But there is no paradox. As more people have the money to move, more are doing so – and at extraordinary personal risk.  .tg-pullquote__global__group{zoom: 1;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:before, .tg-pullquote__global__group:after{content: \"\"; display: table;}.tg-pullquote__global__group:after{clear: both;}.tg-pullquote__inline{float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content{margin: 0 20px 10px 0px; font-size:18px; line-height:23px; font-family:georgia; width:260px; float:left;}.tg-pullquote__content--mobile{float: none; font-size: 18px; margin-left: 4.687%; margin-right: 4.687%; width: 90.626%;}.tg-pullquote__title{font-family:arial; font-weight:bold; font-size:16px; border-top:1px dotted #000000;}.tg-pullquote__quote{color:#007A8F; font-style:italic; margin-top:5px; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__attribution{color:#787878; margin-bottom:5px;}.tg-pullquote__source{}.tg-pullquote__source__link{color:#234B7B; outline:0; text-decoration:none;}.tg-pullquote__source__link:hover{border-bottom: 1px dotted #122842; color: #122842;}.tg-pullquote__share{float:right;}.tg-pullquote__share--icon{background-image:url(\"http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.png\"); background-image: url(\"http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/pullQuotes/assets/share_sprite.svg\"), none; width:26px; height:26px;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink{border-bottom:none;}.tg-pullquote__shareLink:hover{border-bottom:none !important;}.tg-pullquote__share--twitter{margin-right:5px;}.tg-pullquote__share--facebook{background-position: 26px 0;}\n\n\n    \"A photograph of a drowned child is heartbreaking, but should not change policy: a botched response can lead to many more dead children.

The Washington-based Center for Global Development recently set this out, in a study drawing on more than a thousand national censuses over five decades.  When a poor country becomes richer, its emigration rate rises until it becomes as wealthy as Albania or Armenia are today. This process usually takes decades, and only afterwards does wealth subdue emigration. War is a catalyst. If conflict strikes, and the country isn’t quite as poor as it once was, more of those affected now have the means to cross the world. The digital age means they also have the information.  When the world was poorer, Europe could be pretty relaxed about immigration laws. The British Nationality Act of 1948 declared that all 600 million of the King’s subjects had the right to settle in Britain – which, today, seems like lunacy. But then, no one cared: very few of those subjects had the means (or inclination) to migrate to our cold, depopulating island.  Even after shocks like the partition of India, which claimed a million souls and displaced at least 10 times as many, Britain was not deluged with immigration applications. In 1951, we signed the UN Refugee Convention promising to shelter anyone with a “well-founded fear of persecution.” Wars kept being waged, but newcomers arrived at the rate of 100 a day.  Now, they’re arriving at 1,500 a day. Globalisation has transformed the global movement of people, as well as goods and money – and Britain handles this perhaps better than any country in Europe. We are one of the few countries in the world where unemployment rates for immigrants are no higher than for natives, and where there is no far-Right party causing havoc in Parliament.  We impose fairly tough rules (we even deport Frenchmen who don’t work) but Britain is now the most successful melting pot in Europe. The countries currently urging us to take on more asylum seekers are, by and large, the same ones who are in crisis after accepting more than they have been able to handle.  If you misjudge the refugee crisis, you incubate a political crisis: this is the lesson that David Cameron has learnt. Efforts intended to help can end up causing harm, costing more lives. Since the Italian navy decided to send rescue missions to the Mediterranean, the number of people making the crossing (and perishing) has trebled.  Doubtless Angela Merkel meant well when she invited every Syrian to apply for asylum in Germany. But she will be toasted by the new breed of people traffickers, who will now have far more families to extort and leave stranded in Budapest or pack into boats on the coast of Libya.  Who will weep for the child victims of the conflict in Yemen?  Photo: Saleh Al-Obeidi/AFP/Getty Images A photograph of a drowned child is heartbreaking, but should not change policy: a botched response can lead to many more dead children. Hundreds of Yemeni children will likely starve this winter, victims of its civil war – we won’t see the pictures, so we’re unlikely to see anyone petitioning Parliament about them. But it’s no less of a tragedy. There is, of course, more that Britain could and should do for Syrians; even taking 10,000, as Yvette Cooper suggests, is manageable for a country that absorbs this number of immigrants every week. But let’s not pretend our doing so will help the rest of Syria’s four million registered refugees.  The Great Migration is a 21st century problem, far bigger than Syria and bigger than the authorities in Brussels seem able to comprehend. To panic now, as Mrs Merkel is doing, will just bring more to panic about. The solutions of the last century – refugee camps, or the notion that you can stem the flow of migrants with foreign aid – need to be abandoned, and a new agenda needs to be forged. Europe, in short, needs to begin a new conversation. Given that David Cameron is one of the few people in Europe keeping his head throughout this crisis, he’s the ideal man to start it.   \n\n"}

All want to go to Germany. Our job is just to register them.\"  • Britain can't solve the refugee crisis alone  • 'David Cameron is placing himself on the wrong side of history'  Orban was speaking as hundreds of refugees and migrants stormed a train at Budapest's reopened main international railway station, which has become a bottleneck for people trying to head to western Europe via Hungary.  Orban, appearing with European Parliament president Martin Schulz, said he would impose a new package of measures by September 15 to cope with the crisis.  He was speaking after claiming in a German newspaper that Europe faces \"explosive\" consequences of an influx of Muslims.  “Everything which is now taking place before our eyes threatens to have explosive consequences for the whole of Europe,” Orban wrote in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. “Europe’s response is madness. We must acknowledge that the European Union’s misguided immigration policy is responsible for this situation.  Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orban  Photo: Rex “Those arriving have been raised in another religion, and represent a radically different culture. Most of them are not Christians, but Muslims,” he said. “This is an important question, because Europe and European identity is rooted in Christianity. Is it not worrying in itself that European Christianity is now barely able to keep Europe Christian? There is no alternative, and we have no option but to defend our borders.”  “Irresponsibility is the mark of every European politician who holds out the promise of a better life to immigrants and encourages them to leave everything behind and risk their lives in setting out for Europe. If Europe does not return to the path of common sense, it will find itself laid low in a battle for its fate.”  Orban said the EU should tell people “not to come” and said that the EU redistribution quotas were an “invitation”.  \"We Hungarians are full of fear, people in Europe are full of fear because they see that the European leaders, among them the prime ministers, are not able to control the situation,\" Orban during the press conference.  Refugee's storm into a train at the Keleti train station in Budapest, Hungary  Photo: Reuters Orban – under pressure from the far-right Jobbik party at home – is refusing to accept an EU plan for compulsory quotas for asylum seekers and building a razor wire fence along the border with Serbia in a bid to halt the influx. The fence has been criticised by the EU, but Orban said he was obliged to control the border.  “Please, don’t criticise Hungary for doing what is compulsory to be done. Just let Hungary do the job, as it is written in the European regulations.”  \"I came here to inform the president that Hungary did everything possible in order to keep the regulations. We create just now in the Hungarian parliament a new package of regulations, we set up a physical barrier and all these together can provide a new situation in Hungary and in Europe from 15 September.

There was chaos at Keleti station in Budapest on Thursday morning after the police abandoned a two-day blockade of the terminal, allowing migrants camped out in the subterranean concourse outside to rush inside in the hope of catching a train to Germany or other parts of Western Europe.  Families sleep underneath the Keleti train station in Budapest, Hungary  Photo: Eyevine Believing a train was heading for Munich, hundreds of people pushed and shoved their way onto a train as the few remaining police officers in the station area stood by.  Platform 8 of the station became the scene of dangerous overcrowding and screams could be heard as confusion reigned amongst migrants as to where the train was heading, despite the signs on the carriage doors saying it was a service only as far as Sopron, a town in Hungary close to the border with Austria.  Scuffles broke out inside the train and families with small children were among those trying to squeeze their way inside and escape the de facto refugee which had formed outside Keleti, where around 2,000 people have slept on the floor over recent nights.  The information board in the station put up a notice saying that al international services to Western Europe had been cancelled for safety reasons. Loudspeaker announcements asked people to get off the train for Sopron due to overcrowding. Eventually, after the train’s scheduled departure at 10.10 passed, many migrants gave up as they realised they would not be able to cross the border and leave Hungary.  No station staff were present on the platform or at the entrances to the station. A queue built up at customer services, where station staff explained to backpackers why they could not take direct trains towards Vienna or other European destinations today. A station official said that the border with Slovakia was closed and that trains heading towards Germany would all be stopping before the border, meaning onward passengers would have to change.  Hundreds of migrants remain inside Keleti station. \n.global__group{zoom:1}.global__group:after,.global__group:before{content:'';display:table}.global__group:after{clear:both}.float--left{display:-moz-inline-stack;display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;zoom:1}.timeline__container.is__mobile{padding-left:4.687%;padding-right:4.687%}.timeline__title{margin-bottom:20px}.timeline__title__headline{font-family:Georgia,serif;font-size:24px;line-height:28px;color:#CC0000;margin-bottom:15px}.timeline__title__subtitle{-webkit-font-smoothing:antialiased;font-family:'Telesans Text Web';font-size:15px;line-height:21px;color:#565656}.timeline__main{-webkit-font-smoothing:antialiased;font-family:'Telesans Text Web';position:relative;color:#565656;font-size:15px;line-height:21px}.timeline__element{background-color:#F4F4F0;padding:15px 20px 20px 35px}.timeline__element+.timeline__element{margin-top:3px}.timeline__element__leftCont{margin-right:10px;width:13px;height:15px}.timeline__element__bar{height:100%;width:1px;background-color:#777}.timeline__element__title{position:relative;margin-bottom:10px}.timeline__element__title:after{width:13px;height:13px;background-image:url(http://s.telegraph.co.uk/graphics/TimelineGenerator/img/diamond.png);content:'';left:-25px;position:absolute;top:2px}.timeline__element__subtitle{font-size:18px;font-weight:700;line-height:21px;margin-bottom:10px}.timeline__element__date{font-weight:700}.timeline__element__time{color:#CC0000}.timeline__element__media__image{width:100%;max-width:620px}.timeline__element__media__image image{display:block}.video--container{position:relative;width:100%;max-width:620px;margin-bottom:5px}.video--player{padding-bottom:56.27%}.video--player .innerWrapper{width:auto!important;height:auto!important;position:absolute!important;top:0;right:0;left:0;bottom:0}.timeline__element__media__caption{font-size:13px;color:#777;margin-bottom:20px}.timeline__element__text+.timeline__element__title{margin-top:25px}.timeline__bar{position:absolute;top:0;left:16px;height:100%;width:1px}.timeline__bar__fill{position:absolute;height:auto;bottom:0;top:0;left:0;right:0;margin-top:20px;margin-right:0;margin-left:0;background-color:#777;width:100%}.video--container__ooyala--padding{width:100%;padding-bottom:56.25%;position:relative}.video--container__ooyala{position:absolute;top:0;bottom:0;left:0;right:0}\n\n\n\n     Migrant crisis - the last six months \n   \n\n\n\n\n\n       19 April, 2015 \n     \n\n       650 migrants feared dead \n     \n\n\n      Around 650 migrants were feared drowned as a boat carrying 700 capsized in the waters of the Italian island of Lampedusa.

The German Chancellor took a huge political gamble this week by tearing up the EU’s rulebook, while also demanding a new deal that would force Britain to accept hundreds of thousands of refugees.  Faced with a human flood, Mrs Merkel has abandoned the Dublin Convention that requires asylum-seekers to be processed in their country of arrival. Berlin’s new policy will allow Syrian refugees to apply for asylum in Germany, rather than in their first port of call.  Deciding to do such a thing without the approval of Brussels will surely encourage other EU countries to pursue their own migration policies, too. But this is the last thing Mrs Merkel wants. She and President Hollande of France have just called for a new, binding European agreement to share the asylum burden.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives prior her visit to a refugee shelter that was attacked by far-right protesters over the weekend in Heidenau, eastern Germany, Wednesday, Aug. 26, 2015 Her proposals, however, were greeted with incredulity by other member states, their inherent flaw being that they would give millions more migrants an added incentive to come to Europe. Mr Cameron, along with other leaders, is resisting Mrs Merkel’s move, despite moral blackmail from EU and UN officials.  Mrs Merkel may not like it but many Germans, who are expecting a record 800,000 asylum-seekers this year, feel that they have already taken more than their fair share. They blame their coalition government for being a soft touch and street protests are reaching a crescendo. On Thursday, Mrs Merkel was greeted by angry protests and shouts of “traitor” as she visited an embattled refugee hostel near Dresden. Solving this crisis is proving to be the greatest challenge of her career.  The consensus in Berlin is that Europe’s combination of open borders and different national immigration policies is unsustainable. The present uncontrolled influx is not how the system is designed to work – but the scale of the exodus from the Muslim world means that rules are being flouted as each country protects its own interest.  Meanwhile, the lack of border controls within Europe is allowing migrants to make for countries with generous rules on asylum and welfare, especially Germany and the UK. Britain, with a strong economy, is a powerful draw for migrants but we are outside the borderless Schengen area and Theresa May is determined to keep asylum seekers out of the UK. Unsurprisingly, the German media is portraying the Tory government as selfish.  The blame game is, however, as pointless as it is undemocratic. The British public will not accept an EU policy that imposes quotas of migrants without our consent. Nor will most other countries – including Germany. So the EU’s asylum system is buckling and everywhere support is surging for extremist parties of Left and Right. \n\n\ntmgAds.embedPlayer = tmgAds.embedPlayer || {};\ntmgAds.embedPlayer = {width:620,height:349,size:'620x349',vidSize:'620x415'};\nif(typeof(tmgAds.page.platform) != 'undefined' \u0026\u0026 tmgAds.page.platform === \"mobile\") tmgAds.embedPlayer = {width:300,height:169,size:'300x169',vidSize:'300x235'};\ntmgAds.embedPlayer = {\n  'targetId'     : 'embedPlayerWrapper',\n  'platform'     : tmgAds.page.platform,\n  'width'        : tmgAds.embedPlayer.width,\n  'height'       : tmgAds.embedPlayer.height,\n  'size'         : tmgAds.embedPlayer.size,\n  'autoplay'     : 'false',\n  'vidEmbed'     : 'VjaTk0dzrUiXq-OrsFtwoVlNEuXJBomp',\n  'adTag'        : tmgAdsBuildAdTag(\"vid\",tmgAds.embedPlayer.vidSize,\"pfadx\",\";vidsrc=tmg;vt=embed;dcmt=text/xml\",3)\n}\ntmgAds.embedPlayer.remotesrc = 'http://s.telegraph.co.uk/tmgads/tools/ooyala/iframeplayer.html?platform='+tmgAds.page.platform+'\u0026width='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.width+'\u0026height='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.height+'\u0026size='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.size+'\u0026vidEmbed='+tmgAds.embedPlayer.vidEmbed+'\u0026adTag='+encodeURIComponent(tmgAds.embedPlayer.adTag);\ntmgAds.embedPlayer.tmgEmbedPlayer = '\u003ciframe src=\"'+tmgAds.embedPlayer.remotesrc+'\u0026adobeDTM=live\" width=\"'+tmgAds.embedPlayer.width+'\" height=\"'+tmgAds.embedPlayer.height+'\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e';\ndocument.write(tmgAds.embedPlayer.tmgEmbedPlayer);\n\n Mrs Merkel, European figurehead, has the experience and authority to restore order to the anarchy. And Mr Cameron has hitherto enjoyed the best relationship with the chancellor of any European leader. He has, moreover, a direct interest in reforming the EU’s migration regime as it is bound to loom large in the coming referendum.  So will the British and German governments make common cause? They should, but they face very different challenges. Mr Cameron wants to restore national control over migration from inside the EU, while Mrs Merkel wants European control of migration from outside Europe.  Their first priority must be to stabilise the crisis that began with the fallout from the Syrian civil war. That would require the EU to impose much stricter external border controls, while helping Mediterranean countries, the first ports of call, to accommodate asylum-seekers and process their applications. Mrs Merkel has promised to do more to help Greece and Italy cope, and today she will attend a summit in Vienna, where Balkan countries will also demand aid, especially Macedonia, which has declared a state of emergency.  The next step would be to restore a measure of national sovereignty to the larger question of economic migration. Mrs Merkel refuses to compromise on the principle of free movement, but she could show more flexibility by allowing each country to interpret that principle in its own way.  Right now, she faces a stark choice between nation states acting independently or the creation of Fortress Europe. Either the EU permits the restoration of national control over immigration – which means the end of free movement within Europe – or the EU turns itself into a fortress, excluding genuine refugees as well as economic migrants, while preserving its internal freedom of movement. It will not be lost on older readers that “Fortress Europe” – Festung Europa – was Hitler’s name for Nazi-occupied Europe. Such a reactionary idea would be impractical as well as deeply unpopular.  window['cf697204-e227-4d24-a30f-9ed7beae103c'] = {'yLabel':'Population','valuePrefix':'','valueSuffix':'','includeZero':false,'dateFormat':'DD/MM/YYYY','percent':false,'enableSpillover':false};Foreign-born population of the UK\n\n\n\n\n\nEU-born\nNon EU-born\n\n\n\n\n2004\n1491000\n3767000\n\n\n2005\n1584000\n3996000\n\n\n2006\n1778000\n4256000\n\n\n2007\n1987000\n4421000\n\n\n2008\n2136000\n4633000\n\n\n2009\n2215000\n4806000\n\n\n2010\n2314000\n4920000\n\n\n2011\n2564000\n5097000\n\n\n2012\n2652000\n5170000\n\n\n2013\n2743000\n5178000\n\n\n\n\n  Meanwhile, having unilaterally abrogated the Dublin Convention, Mrs Merkel can hardly expect other countries to accept an EU diktat, especially if it obliges them to absorb migrants in very large numbers. So perhaps Europe would indeed do better to adopt a more empirical, every-man-for-himself solution, giving states free rein to decide for themselves how to deal with migration. It is pretty much what Germany is doing now.  But this would of course have serious implications for the European project and its very identity. What should Europe be? Inclusive and engaged with the world? Or exclusive and protectionist?  This gathering storm will test the idea of European integration – as well as leaders’ political careers – to destruction. As the crisis boosts the British “No” campaign, the prospect of Brexit should enable Mr Cameron to drive a harder bargain in his renegotiation, if he truly wants it. But equally, public opinion will harden further against him and Europe if he lets the crisis escalate much further.  After all, if Europe cannot make up its mind about who counts as a European, what is the point of belonging to the EU?  Daniel Johnson is the editor of Standpoint \n\n"}

Danish police announced on Thursday that they would no longer detain refugees aiming to travel through the country to Sweden, after days of chaos at its borders with Germany as security forces tried to curb the rising inflow. 3,200 people have entered the country since Sunday as a wave of migrants, many of them Syrian, pushes north through Europe in the hope of refuge.  Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Lofven, attacked Denmark’s “unfortunate decision” to send trains onward to its neighbour without attempting to register anyone on board, as the pressure of the greatest refugee crisis since the Second World War pushed EU asylum rules to breaking point.  “This is an unfortunate decision,” Mr Lofven said. “The Dublin Regulation says that the country which refugees first come to is the country where the should be registered. This is how we act in Sweden, and we intend to follow the rules.”  Refugees sit in a train headed to Sweden as it leaves Copenhagen Central Station  Photo: REUTERS/Linda Kastrup/Scanpix Danish security forces had briefly closed a major ferry and rail crossing after a standoff at the port of Rodby with two trains carrying 350 refugees demanding to be allowed through to Sweden, but re-opened it on Wednesday, as well as a motorway link which had been shut on and off over recent days.  A temporary asylum centre set up to register asylum seekers in Rodby has now been closed, with refugees left to travel on by train unhindered.  The country’s national train operator DSB said on Thursday it was now allowing refugees to travel through the country for free.  Jens Henrik Hojberg, Denmark’s national police commissioner, said that the authorities had been forced to stop trying to register all refugees, as they lacked the resources.  “We obviously cannot not keep so many people in detention indefinitely, so there is no other option than to leave them at liberty, and therefore we cannot prevent them from travelling wherever they want,” he said.  According to the Danish Ministry of Justice, just 400 of the refugees who have crossed over into Denmark since Sunday have applied for asylum in the country.  “The large majority of the arrivals have refused to communicate with Danish authorities,” it said in a statement. “Most of those who have had contact with the Danish police have stated that they want to go to Sweden to claim asylum.”  Sweden expects to receive 80,000 refugees this year and has more asylum seekers per capita than any other European nation thanks to a generous immigration policy allowing automatic permanent residency for Syrians.  Refugees, mainly from Syria, wait to board a train for Sweden at Padborg station in Denmark  Photo: EPA/CLAUS FISKER Denmark is not the only country in Europe pushed into taking extraordinary measures by the scale of the crisis, as the stream of refugees moving up towards Germany and northern Europe continues unabated.  Austrian railways ordered all train services to and from Hungary stopped on Thursday after what it described as “massive overcrowding” by refugees, while Macedonia said it was now considering building a Hungarian-style border fence.  More than 3,000 refugees arrived overnight at the Nickelsdorf im Burgenland rail border crossing, according to police in Austria.  By 10.30am there were 3,700 refugees crowded into the border station, with thousands more on their way from Hungary.  Buses and shuttle trains taking the arriving refugees on to Vienna were unable to cope with the numbers and the Austrian army was deployed to the station to keep order.  The Austrian railway company OeBB said in a statement it had no choice but to temporarily suspend service “because of massive overcrowding on trains arriving from Hungary”.  The company added it was selling no more tickets to Hungary.  “We don’t know how many refugees we have to prepare ourselves for,” Christian Stella, deputy director of the Burgenland state police, told Krone newspaper.  Around 1,500 were expected on a train from the Hungarian town of Gyor, he said.  In Budapest, there were reports of police cordons holding back crowds of some 2,000 refugees who wanted to board trains to Austria.  Some 3,300 refugees crossed from Serbia into Hungary after having made their way through the country from Macedonia, according to Serbian reports, while there were another 4,000 massed in the Serbian border town of Kanjiza.  Macedonian Foreign Minister Nikola Poposki said on Thursday that a fence or an army deployment may be necessary to secure the country's border with Greece.  In an interview with Hungarian business weekly Figyelo, he said Macedonia will probably also need “some kind of a physical defence” though this would not be a long-term solution.  “But if we take seriously what Europe is asking us to do, we will need that, too. Either soldiers or a fence or a combination of the two,” he said. \n\n"}

His exhausted father holds up a handful of grass: “For three days now we’ve had nothing else to eat but this.”  Ashraf, who set out from Syria with his father in November, has just been caught after crossing into Hungary from Serbia, with the aim of reaching Germany. He and around 60 compatriots, including families with babies and a dozen children under 10, were captured by Hungarian police and rounded up between a forest and an industrial estate.

Germany needs us, we are good people,” Ashraf says.  He and his father, like thousands of others, passed through Turkey, Greece and Macedonia. They walked for seven hours a day, for seven months.  According to government statistics, they were among at least 61,000 migrants who have entered Hungary this year, up sharply from 43,000 in all of 2014. This is more refugees per capita than any other EU country apart from Sweden. Around 95 per cent of them cross from Serbia, which is not a member of the EU but has started accession talks.   Migrants protect themselves from the rain after being captured by Hungarian police (Andras D Hajdu/The Telegraph)   As a gateway to both the EU and the Schengen passport-free zone, Hungary has become the hidden front line of Europe’s migration crisis. Its government wants to ensure that Ashraf is among the last to enter the country via this route. Hungary – the first nation to dismantle its borders before the collapse of Communism in 1989 – is planning to erect a 110-mile long, 13ft-high barbed wire fence along its border with Serbia. The plan has outraged the United Nations and the EU. Natasha Bertaud, a European Commission spokesman, said last week: “We have only just torn down walls in Europe: we should not be putting them up.”   Migrants in a police van by the border near the Hungarian town of Szeged (Andras D Hajdu/The Telegraph)   • Britain should take its fair share of migrants, UN representative says  The myriad reasons for the sharp increase in migrants through Hungary include poverty and state corruption in Kosovo, the armed conflicts and civil wars in Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq, and the deaths of thousands who tried to cross the Mediterranean from North Africa.  Viktor Orbán, the populist Hungarian prime minister, has been among the harshest critics – along with Britain – of EU plans to manage the upsurge in migrant numbers by spreading the burden around the 28-nation bloc.   17-year-old Ashraf (Andras D Hajdu/The Telegraph)   Ashraf was one of 1,141 refugees, including 106 children apprehended by police officers in Csongrád county, south Hungary, last Wednesday. The Telegraph witnessed the capture of around 200 Syrian migrants in the forests of Hattyas, near the southern Hungarian town of Szeged. A policeman at the scene said a picture published by the AFP agency had alerted them to the whereabouts of the migrants in the forest, after which around 100 officers were scrambled.  Among those held is Abdul, a 22-year-old banking and finance graduate, and his brother Adel — both former members of the middle-classes of Damascus.  Abdul says: “After I left Syria, I worked in Istanbul as a waiter for seven months, but if you are Syrian they pay you three times less for doing the same job. Then we walked through Greece, Macedonia and Serbia to Hungary.”  Tips are shared on social media by compatriots making the trip. It is well known, for example, that Greece, Macedonia and Serbia have little or no system in place for asylum seekers, which can make passage easier. But the slick operation of the Hungarian police has taken them by surprise.   Migrants attempting to escape near the Hungarian border (Andras D Hajdu/The Telegraph)   Nearby The Telegraph meets three 23-year-olds who have walked from the Democratic Republic of Congo. “What country is this?” they ask.  A housewife who lives in the nearby village of Gyálarét says she gets up at 4am every morning to water and hoe her garden. Around two weeks ago, she began to see lines of people walking silently down her street. At first, she was scared by such an unusual sight, but after a few more glances she was struck by how worn out and desperate they looked. Then she noticed their children, clinging sleepily to their mothers. After a couple of days some people in the village started to put out buckets of water and food in front of their porches.   A migrant family sleeps on the street after being released by Szeged police (Andras D Hajdu/The Telegraph)   Ashraf says he and his father were among around 200 refugees who went on hunger strike in Gazi Baba refugee camp in the Macedonian capital of Skopje, to protest against the inhumane treatment.  When back on the road, “our group met mafia guys in Macedonia. They hit some of us here”, Ashraf says, pointing towards his head. As they neared Hungary, four men with knives and stun guns, dressed as Serbian policemen, threatened them and took their money. Then they crossed the River Tisza into Hungary and the forest.  Another two groups of around 80 people are caught over the next hour. They huddle under a waterproof sheet provided by the police. A pair of Syrian men in their early twenties make a run for it, sprinting back towards the forest. They outrun the guards and disappear from sight, but are brought back around 20 minutes later, this time in handcuffs.   Migrants warm up in a disused brick factory nicknamed The Jungle (Andras D Hajdu/The Telegraph)   After two hours in the heavy rain, a white minibus arrives to take the women and children to a refugee camp in a nearby hangar.  For those planning a border jump from northern Serbia, and with the money to pay for it, there are several hostels operating in Kanizsa. For those without there is The Jungle: a disused brick factory just over the border, on the outskirts of the Serbian town of Subotica.  On arrival at The Jungle we see half a dozen Afghan boys gathered around a well. One crouches precariously on the edge. Another holds up a phone that serves as a makeshift shaving mirror. The complex behind them is composed of several long, derelict red brick buildings. Behind the buildings a creaky train passes a giant refuse heap. The 65ft red brick tower completes the godforsaken look, which brings to mind the darkest chapter of 20th-century Europe.   The disused brick factory on the outskirts of the Serbian town of Subotica (Andras D Hajdu/The Telegraph)   Few of the hundreds of Afghans here speak English, but one manages to explain that he has made it this far with a combination of buses, cheap flights and the well-trod route to Serbia via Turkey, Greece and Macedonia. Several of the men – there are only men here – say that the Serbian police turn up twice a day to ask for ID, and demand a €50 (£35) bribe from those without papers.  In the fields behind the complex, a Kurd from Iraq silently scribbles some Farsi into my notebook.  Meanwhile, the man who has made the longest trip of all – from Pakistan – tells me he had been living in a hostel in Parachinar, having just completed an MBA, when he was threatened with his life by members of al-Qaeda, and fled.   A migrant stand by the former brick factory nicknamed The Jungle (Andras D Hajdu/The Telegraph)   “They kill Shia Muslims and Christians like animals: I lost my uncle in a suicide bomb attack,” he says.  On the way back to Budapest we pass several billboards of the Orbán government’s anti-immigration campaign. They tell migrants “If you come to Hungary, do not take the jobs of Hungarians” and “If you come to Hungary, you must respect our culture.”  However, as they are written in the notoriously difficult Hungarian language, it seems these are not meant for the migrants, but for Hungarian citizens.  Our driver says his girlfriend’s father, once a migrant to Hungary from Iraq who now works as a translator for a government ministry, has translated the Farsi scribbled in my reporter’s notebook. It says, in urban, educated Farsi, “Man is born free, and should live that way.” \n\n"}

The conscience of other governments is easily pricked. Though many are complaining that Angela Merkel’s willingness to take up to 800,000 asylum seekers in one year has made matters worse by offering hope to others – and, therefore, encouragement. In public, Germany’s establishment is trying to occupy the high ground, chiding those who refuse to welcome the world’s huddled masses. But there has been violence: in Berlin, asylum centres have been set alight, Right-wing protestors clash with police. Aside from the pressures on schools and hospitals that unmanaged migration brings, moderates also have to consider the danger of rising xenophobia. If rational men and women do not address this problem, reckless demagogues will.   Of course, these demagogues are to be found on the Left as well as the Right. They typically share an opinion that if Britain withdrew further from the world, then the world would leave it alone: end the wars and you end the flow of humanity. This is bad logic. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, the two largest groups of people crossing the Mediterranean are from Afghanistan and Syria. Afghanistan was unstable before the West drove the Taliban from power. It has only become more unstable since the West left. \n\nStrikes in Syria are meaningless if we keep slashing our military\n The Syrian civil war certainly has nothing to do with the West. On the contrary, it has arguably been prolonged by a lack of international action – the British Parliament voted against military intervention in 2013. Even today, it is not known whether Labour would formally lend its backing to military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Jeremy Corbyn and the hard Left tendency argue that intervention would make the crisis worse. It is hard to imagine how. Since 2011, 12 million Syrians have been displaced from their homes and four million forced to flee abroad. They leave behind a dystopia in which the Syrian government kills its own citizens and the rebel army butchers non-believers. The lesson of the past 10 years is that if Britain tries to withdraw from the world, then the world will arrive at its doorstep pleading for help.

The EU cannot cope with the magnitude of this flood and the fantasy that it can will only attract more people, leading to yet more tragedy. Europeans are probably in the mood to reconsider the Schengen principle, while the awful scenes in Austria prove the need to invest in law enforcement. Western leaders must also acknowledge that what is taking place is not unique but that it is bound to continue, which is all the more reason to do more to re-establish control now. Will Europe be ready for another crisis next summer? For the sake of its own citizens and for the desperate refugees, it must be better prepared. \n\n"}

(Darko Vojinovic/AP)  BRUSSELS – Amid the largest refugee crisis in Europe since the Balkan Wars of the 1990s, a tide of thousands of asylum-seekers is reaching the continent’s shores faster than they can be accommodated. So far, the European Union’s 28 nations have been unable to agree on a solution. Ahead of a European Commission proposal  Wednesday for a system to spread asylum-seekers across all E.U. countries, here are a few of the options Europe is considering: 1) Doing nothing. Europe  tried to make a plan to share out refugees earlier in the summer. At the time, they were talking about only 40,000 people. But that failed after many countries, especially in eastern and central Europe, bridled at being required to take in a set number of refugees. Now the proposal is expected to be triple that – amid deep doubts about nations’ ability to come to an agreement. Pros: Few, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Each European leader answers to his or her own electorate, which sometimes makes broad E.U. deals very difficult. The status quo is good for countries that don’t like refugees and under current E.U. rules can deport asylum-seekers back to the first E.U. country they entered. That’s almost always Greece, Italy or Hungary, which are buckling under the influx. Cons: “If Europe fails on the question of refugees, then it won’t be the Europe we wished for,” said German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has thrown open her nation’s doors to asylum-seekers. She warned that without a Europe-wide plan, individual nations might need to reimpose border controls, a major blow to European unity. And with some nations far more generous to refugees than others, human smugglers will prosper, ferrying asylum-seekers to Germany and Sweden, with potentially tragic consequences. 2) Quotas. This is what European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will propose  Wednesday. He’ll suggest relocating 120,000 asylum-seekers from the front-line nations of Greece, Italy and Hungary and spreading them across Europe, according to European accounts of the draft plans. Together, Germany, France and Spain would take more than half of them, according to a rough draft published by Spain’s El Pais newspaper. The remainder would be spread across the rest of Europe. Pros: It would help reduce the burden on those three European nations that are on the edges of the European Union and have buckled under the weight of the more than 400,000 asylum-seekers who have arrived so far this year. And though the proposal would fall far short of the numbers needed to address the full scale of the problem, it would still set up a system that could later be expanded. Nations that have resisted hosting refugees, such as Slovakia, may be able to send money instead as a compromise measure. “Considering the current politics, it is the most pragmatic idea on the table right now,” said Elizabeth Collett, the director of the Brussels-based Migration Policy Institute Europe. Cons: It’s a drop in the bucket. Germany plans to take in 800,000 asylum-seekers this year, and says it’s ready for 500,000 a year for the next several years. Facing those numbers, the E.U. plan simply doesn’t do enough. And there are many thorny questions to work out: What happens when an asylum-seeker who has family in France gets assigned to Lithuania instead? In a Europe without borders, how would policymakers ensure the refugees stay put? And what happens to asylum-seekers who arrive beyond the quotas? Do they pile up in refugee camps on Europe’s edges, or do they simply keep pushing through to Western Europe? And many nations, especially in Eastern and Central Europe, are opposed to quotas. “I do not consider them any real solution to the migration crisis,\" Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said Monday, according to the Czech News Agency.   3) Military action against the smugglers who bring help refugees get to Europe. Britain and others have been pushing for U.N. Security Council authorization to deploy navies to board and intercept the flimsy boats that set sail across the Mediterranean from Libya and Egypt to Europe’s shores. The boats, operated by human smugglers, are dangerous, frequently sinking during the passage. More than 2,700 migrants have died this year. Pros: The plan would discourage the smugglers, who often have ties to organized crime and profit tremendously from the some of the world’s most vulnerable populations. Fewer boats crossing the Mediterranean would reduce the immediate crisis for Europe and might discourage some of the economic migrants coming illegally from Africa and South Asia. And a stepped-up naval presence in the Mediterranean might make search-and-rescue operations more successful when smugglers’ ships capsize. Cons: Stopping smugglers doesn’t address the root causes of the refugee crisis. It just displaces the burden to other countries. And in some ways, these plans are a solution to yesterday’s problem. Over the course of this year, the bulk of migrant traffic to Europe has shifted westward to the Balkans: asylum-seekers make a short sea hop from Turkey to nearby Greek islands, then travel to Western Europe overland through Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary. The naval plans wouldn’t do anything about that at all. 4) Resettling refugees directly from camps surrounding Syria, and from Syria. Remember \"Schindler’s List?\" Or the U.S. efforts to resettle refugees from Vietnam in the 1970s? This would be the 21st-century equivalent, more or less: E.U. diplomats handing out visas on the ground in the countries where more than 4 million Syrian refugees have settled. Pros: This is arguably the most humane option, since it would  make an end-run around smugglers. Refugees could simply get on a plane from Turkey, Lebanon or Jordan and fly straight to Europe, saving the danger of a smuggled, overland trip that sometimes costs up to $10,000. It’s what British Prime Minister David Cameron suggested  Monday when he said Britain would take in 20,000 Syrian refugees directly from the Middle Eastern camps over the next five years. “We want to encourage people not to make that dangerous crossing in the first place,” Cameron said. Cons: Realistically, there’s little political support in Europe to do this on a scale that would actually relieve pressure on the camps. Cameron’s commitment over the next five years is equivalent to what Germany took in this weekend alone. And it’s not clear that handing out visas in the region would stop the separate overland flow to Europe. That’s because the most vulnerable refugees typically jump to the front of the line for resettlement schemes such as the British one. The asylum-seekers currently coming to Europe by land are the ones with the resources to pay a sometimes hefty price to smugglers. “When you are facing a humanitarian disaster, when you are facing the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, when you say, ‘I think we can resettle 25 people,' people would just laugh in your face,” said Elspeth Guild, a migration specialist at the Brussels-based Center for European Policy Studies  5) Bring peace to Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Eritrea. Those are the conflict-ridden countries that are supplying the bulk of the asylum-seekers to Europe. If there wasn’t violence there, Europe wouldn’t have a refugee problem. Pros: Everyone’s happy. Cons: Not going to happen anytime soon."}

There was little unity ahead of an emergency meeting planned to be held in two weeks, despite a growing agreement that Europe’s unpredictable asylum system has spurred migrants to take dangerous steps to scale the continent’s high walls. The problem has grown worse by the day, with aid groups in Greece saying that new arrivals were on track Monday to top record-breaking weekend highs. From Greece, migrants flow northward through the Balkans in an attempt to reach Western Europe, where generous benefits can await. But if they are caught by poorer E.U. countries along the way, their future can be grim, a disparity that has spurred many to pay smugglers to sneak them into the heart of Europe. That gamble can have tragic consequences. Last week, the bodies of 71 presumed migrants were found in the back of a delivery truck on an Austrian roadside. They are thought to have suffocated,   [As tragedies shock Europe, a bigger refu­gee crisis looms in the Middle East]  At a time when Germany is taking the lion’s share of refugees — an estimated 800,000 this year alone — Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday urged other nations in the European Union to share the burden. She called for new E.U.-run asylum processing centers in entry nations such as Greece to better assess and safely funnel refugees deeper into Europe.        1 of 24       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                       Skip Ad   ×           Suspects arrested in deaths of migrants      View Photos   A Hungarian court placed four men under preliminary arrest for being involved in the deaths of 71 migrants found in a truck in Austria.

Top E.U. officials plan to meet Sept. 14 to try to streamline the fragmented asylum process.  The leaders of Germany and France want to achieve that goal by speeding deportations of economic migrants while allocating more resources to people fleeing the wars in Syria, Iraq and elsewhere. They have also proposed a quota system under which each of the 28 E.U. nations commits to resettle a certain number of refugees, taking aim at countries such as Hungary, which is building a fence to keep migrants out. “Our responsibility is to make sure that asylum rights are respected,” French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said Monday during a visit to the French port city of Calais, where migrants seeking to reach Britain have gathered. “To do so, we cannot build barbed-wire fences against those who are tortured in their own countries.” But there were signs that unity within Europe’s consensus-driven policymaking would be elusive. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico on Monday firmly rejected any decision that would force his nation to take in a fixed number of refugees. “We strongly reject any quotas,” Fico told reporters in the Slovakian capital, Bratislava, according to the news agency Reuters. “We will wake up one day and have 100,000 people from the Arab world, and that is a problem I would not like Slovakia to have.” Britain, too, seems unlikely to throw open its doors. Over the weekend, British Home Secretary Theresa May said she wanted to cut back even legal migration from other E.U. nations.   [Black route: One family’s journey from Aleppo to Austria]  The patchwork of responses in Europe appears to be fueling a booming trade for smugglers, who help migrants get from less-generous nations such as Hungary into Germany, which awards far more benefits to refugees. Migrants are under pressure because of the wide disparities in the way European countries have responded to the crisis. A quirk of European law allows nations to deport asylum-seekers to the first E.U. country where their presence was registered by authorities. Hungary’s far-right leaders have had the toughest response in Europe, stringing a line of razor wire along their country’s 109-mile border with Serbia and building a taller fence behind it. Crowds of asylum-seekers packed Budapest’s fin-de-siecle train station on Monday. There were signs that Hungarian authorities were relaxing their hard-line stance, allowing hundreds of migrants onto trains headed to Austria, from where many planned to continue on to Germany.  The unpredictable policies have fueled many migrants’ willingness to pay as much as several thousand euros to smugglers who move them to their destinations out of sight from authorities. E.U. leaders have grown increasingly concerned about the problem.  “The only people who benefit from unilateralism are the smugglers,” said Alexander Betts, director of the Refugee Studies Center at the University of Oxford. “About the only area where there’s consensus in Europe is that the current system is dysfunctional.” Separately, Greece’s coast guard said Monday that it had picked up more than 2,400 migrants in dozens of sea-based search-and-rescue missions over the weekend, a sign that the flow of asylum-seekers is continuing unabated.    [A glimpse of what it’s like for refugees transported in a small van]   Aid workers on the Greek island of Lesvos, a first port of call for many migrants coming from Turkey, which neighbors Syria, said it was swiftly becoming overwhelmed with new asylum-seekers, who are arriving faster than others can be transported away. “The system broke this weekend, particularly yesterday,” said Simon Clarke, deputy team leader of the International Rescue Committee team on Lesvos. In a telephone interview, he said Monday’s numbers appeared likely to rival the about 4,000 who arrived a day earlier — nearly four times as many as had been coming just 10 days ago. Refugee advocates also want to establish a process by which asylum-seekers could file applications with Europe even before they cross the continent’s borders. Armed with the proper paperwork, they could bypass the dangerous sea journey altogether. But even the most generous E.U. nations may be wary of creating too streamlined a process for refugee claims, fearful that they would make it too easy for the millions of Syrians who have fled to Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan to move to Europe, analysts say. “It’s not the fear of who comes this year, but of how many could come next year, and the unknown, that sometimes holds politicians back from establishing a process that would help countries like Turkey and Lebanon,” said Elizabeth Collett, director of the Migration Policy Institute Europe.

Most endured a perilous crossing to Greece aboard rafts and boats, some barely fit to sail. They traversed Greece, a nation paralyzed by economic crisis and too poor to handle a flow of people that in July hit a record high. At the border with Macedonia late last week, they trudged through a wall of riot police, who fought them back with tear gas before relenting. Now, the asylum-seekers, thousands a day, are racing into Hungary, which is rushing to complete a barbed-wire border fence by the end of the month to force them to seek other routes. It is a long parade of misery unparalleled in Europe in recent years. But the continent has so far failed to agree how to respond. Amid a refugee crisis that by some measures is the worst since World War II, individual nations are being left to improvise their own measures. In Hungary, that is taking the form of 108 miles of barbed wire and fencing. The crisis is shaking fundamental tenets of European life, including the principle of free movement between most of the nations of the European Union. It is fueling a surge of anti-migrant sentiment in the countries that are housing the bulk of the asylum-seekers, Germany and Sweden. And it is straining the weakest countries, such as Greece, that are on migration’s front lines. “Unless we do something, we will become a lifeboat sinking under the weight of people holding on to it and drowning everybody, both those seeking help and those offering help,” said Janos Lazar, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s chief of staff, at a ceremony last week celebrating the founding of Hungary.   The surging numbers of asylum-seekers are being propelled by violence in the Middle East, instability in Africa and poverty in South Asia. Many who fled the war in Syria and stayed for years in neighboring nations are giving up on returning home. Fresh waves are leaving because of the violence of the Islamic State. Germany alone expects 800,000 asylum-seekers this year, a fourfold increase over 2014. The overall E.U. numbers have tripled compared with last year. According to E.U. law, asylum-seekers are supposed to apply for help in their first port of entry. In reality, many front-line countries give them transit papers or look the other way as they slip onward to richer nations within Europe’s borderless Schengen zone. Their arrivals are reverberating around Europe. Earlier in August, thousands of refugees piled up in Calais, France, seeking to cross to Britain through the railway tunnel that exits there. On Saturday, the Italian coast guard rescued about 4,400 migrants from overcrowded ships off the coast of Libya. Even the theoretical idea of refugees is controversial: Slovakia, which has taken in just a handful, said last week that it wanted only Christian asylum-seekers before reversing itself. Tiny Baltic nations have revolted at a proposal to make them each shelter a couple of hundred. “All of those dynamics point to a Europe that is not finding ways to cooperate,” said Alexander Betts, director of the Refugee Studies Center at the University of Oxford. “And while Europe squabbles, people die.” An obstacle, not barrier In Hungary, workers have raced to complete the fence by the end of August. In some stretches of the 108-mile-long frontier with Serbia, it is composed of tall coils of razor wire. In others, it is a 10-foot-tall fence. The construction of the barrier is rich with irony, since one of the first holes in the Iron Curtain was created by Hungary’s 1989 decision to cut open its border fence with Austria to allow East German asylum-seekers to flee there. In 2004, when Hungary joined the European Union, it joyfully cut through the remainder of its border fence with Austria. On Monday, a record 2,093 asylum-seekers crossed into Hungary, about double the flow of most days in recent weeks, according to police figures. Tuesday’s number looked likely to rival Monday’s, said Babar Baloch, a Budapest-based spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).   After migrants inside a camp on the border with Serbia chanted \"U.N.\" and \"help us,\" Hungarian police shot clouds of teargas into the crowds, dispersing the group. Hungary made plans on Aug. 26 to reinforce its southern border with helicopters, mounted police and dogs. (Reuters)   “What these fences do is push these people into the hands of more-ruthless smugglers and put them in even more danger,” Baloch said. But it does not stop them. “They have already taken so many risks. So they will take more risks.”  Local leaders say that the fence is not enough. “It isn't worth anything,” said Istvan Fackelmann, the deputy mayor of Asotthalom, a small Hungarian border town. “They pass by or climb over.” Hungary is just a waypoint for most of the migrants. But each step of their journey has been getting more difficult. Greece, the first E.U. entry point for most of them, nearly was kicked out of the euro zone in July, further challenging its ability to handle the record flows of asylum-seekers. Macedonia is their next step, but on Thursday it suddenly decided to close a major border crossing, sending out riot-gear-clad soldiers who formed a wall with their shields that held back a jostling crowd of thousands. The riot squad used tear gas to push people back toward Greece. “People were coming from behind, they were pushing and shoving, and they were passing children to the front because they thought the children could go through,” said Alexandra Krause, a senior protection officer with the UNHCR who watched the scene at the Gevgelija crossing on Thursday and Friday. When the Macedonian government relented and reopened the border late Friday, she said, a backlog of about 7,500 asylum-seekers continued the journey northward through the Balkans by rail and bus. On Tuesday the migrant flows were much calmer, she said by telephone from the border crossing. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said this week she would demand that other European nations take in asylum-seekers. The dilemma is dominating her schedule. On Wednesday, she plans to visit Heidenau, a town in Germany’s ex-communist east where hundreds of anti-immigrant protesters rioted Saturday as refugees arrived by bus. On Thursday, she will attend a summit on the Western Balkans that will focus on the flows of migrants. “Germany is a country that respects the dignity of every human being,” Merkel said Monday, speaking alongside French President François Hollande after meeting with him about the crisis. Other European countries are “not currently implementing” their laws on asylum, she said.  Gergo Saling in Budapest contributed to this report.

The newcomers from Syria and other war-ravaged nations would enjoy freshly redone floors, cute balconies and shiny, modern appliances in a cheerful building near a timber-framed pub.  Then Meissen’s goodwill went up in smoke. On a cool night six weeks ago, suspected right-wing arsonists struck the building, scorching its interior and rendering it uninhabitable days before the ­asylum-seekers were to move in. The attack added Meissen, a gothic castle town of 30,000 on the Elbe River, to a string of German cities caught up in an escalating rash of violence against refugees.  [‘Let the hag burn’: Xenophobic attacks in Germany ignite firestorm]  The acts include an ugly spate of arson targeting refugee centers as well as physical attacks on refugees themselves, marking the return of what critics say is an unnerving brand of xenophobia to Western Europe’s most populous nation.   German news anchor Claus Kleber of ZDF television welled up as he told the story of a Bavarian bus driver who welcomed 15 refugees on his bus with this announcement: \"I have an important message for people from the whole world in this bus: Welcome!\" (The Washington Post)   The attacks are undercutting Germany’s image as the country leading the effort to aid a record flow of refugees into Europe, highlighting the rising social tensions in the region amid the avalanche of asylum-seekers. At the same time, the violence has ignited a heated national debate over what pundits here say is a rise in overt racism and intolerance — in a nation highly sensitive to both because of Nazi-era atrocities. All this is happening as Germany takes in more asylum-seekers than any other nation in Europe — a number set to reach an estimated 500,000 this year alone — while quickly running out of places to house them. As a result, the national government in Berlin is turning to insular and almost wholly white enclaves to take in the newcomers, who are mostly from the Middle East and Africa. In communities such as Meissen, in Germany’s formerly communist east, that has been a recipe for friction. “In east Germany, we have had 25 years of very powerful influence by neo-Nazi culture. Few immigrants were going there out of fear of being threatened,” said Anetta Kahane, chairwoman of the pro-refugee Amadeu Antonio Foundation in Berlin. “Now you see these asylum-seekers placed in cities in the east, a part of the country that is completely white. Sometimes the response is pure racism.” A surge in aggression The arson in Meissen, for instance, immediately exposed a fierce strain of opposition to the new refugee center. A new local anti-refugee group — the Homeland Defense Initiative — drew as many as 650 supporters to a rally last week, far more than pro-refugee groups have managed to muster. Many neighbors who live near the burned refugee center are blaming not the arsonists but the building’s owner — local developer Ingolf Brumm — for having agreed to turn it into a shelter. After Brumm publicly denounced the fire, he and his family received death threats and were viciously harassed online. To protect him, police began patrolling his nearby home office. Recently arrived refugees already living in Meissen have also become targets. One Syrian dentist who was assigned to live in Meissen and arrived Aug. 1 said he has had stones thrown at his apartment door, glue put in his lock and obscenities hurled at him from the street. “After the fire, the neighbors yelled out at me, saying ‘Good,’ and ‘It’s about time someone did something to stop this,’ ” Brumm said as he surveyed the damage to his building last week. “I thought I knew the citizens of Meissen, but I was wrong. There are good people here but also people with hate in their hearts.”   One neighbor shedding no tears over the torching is Wolfgang Hempel, 65, a retired electrician who lives adjacent to the attacked building. Referring to Brumm, Hempel said he “hates his guts” for leasing the building to the city for a refugee center. “Germany is turning black,” Hempel said, citing the massive influx of refugees from Africa and the Middle East. “Soon only dark-skinned people will be living here. It can’t go on like this. . . . And these days, everybody puts you in a Nazi corner just for voicing your opinion.” Aggression against the mounting number of refugees coming into Europe has surfaced in France, Greece and other nations in the region. And the German public overall remains relatively more tolerant than the populations of many other European nations. Unlike France and Holland, for instance, anti-immigrant nationalists in Germany are still struggling at the polls. The incidents in Germany include at least six cases of arson and the beating of a 23-year-old African refu­gee by five Germans that left him with serious injuries. But the attacks are not as severe as the wave of anti-foreigner violence that swept Germany in the early and mid-1990s. In one infamous 1993 attack, for instance, neo-Nazis set ablaze the home of Turkish immigrants in the rust belt region of North Rhine-Westphalia, killing five people and injuring 14 others. Nonetheless, the number of acts of aggression against refugee homes in Germany is rapidly rising — reaching 202 so far this year, compared with 198 during all of 2014. Last month, a group of right-wing protesters attacked Red Cross workers in the eastern German city of Dresden as they sought to set up a tent compound for refugees. ‘Let the hag burn’ The attacks have put Germany on edge, igniting a social media firestorm while raising lofty questions about what modern Germany stands for. In one high-profile commentary this month, German anchorwoman Anja ­Reschke issued a blistering on-air critique of the attacks and the verbal vitriol circulating against refugees on German social media. Rather than anonymous comments, many are now being openly signed, indicating, she said, that hate has become more socially acceptable. She suggested that those Germans who remain quiet are also guilty. “If you’re not of the opinion that all refugees are spongers who should be hunted down, burned or gassed, then you should make that known very clearly,” she said in her commentary. The spot — viewed more than 15 million times online — provoked an outpouring of support, she said. But it also produced a flood of even more foul comments aimed at her.  [Meet Angela Merkel, a migrant baby born in Germany]  “I received e-mails saying ‘Let the hag burn’ and calling me a ‘negro-gypsy-whore,’ ” Reschke, a white ethnic German, said in a telephone interview. “And then there were the people who said, ‘Look, I’m afraid our race is getting polluted by all those evil people from the whole of Africa, but no, I’m not a Nazi.’ ” Although the attacks have been scattered nationwide, some of the worst have been in the former communist east where diversity levels are extremely low. While one major anti-refugee movement that launched last year — known as PEGIDA — has begun to fade, it has been replaced by several splinter groups and wholly different anti-refugee and far-right groups that have sparked alarm among German politicians. In Meissen, pro-refugee activists, including the Rev. Bernd Oehler, 55, have led an effort to counter the naysayers and welcome the newcomers, staging food and clothing drives and organizing rallies and choir celebrations to show their support. But Oehler conceded that a vocal minority of strong opposition remains across the former East Germany, where economic development still lags behind the wealthier west. “We have a problem with the middle of society,” he said. “They are afraid. They don’t know about their futures, and now there’s a new issue for them to worry about with the refugees. They were looking for a scapegoat, and they found one.”  Stephanie Kirchner contributed to this report.

The late-night offer came after days of efforts to repel migrants fleeing war and poverty who have streamed into Hungary in a bid to reach Western Europe, where they hope to begin new lives. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban had painted his hard-line approach against the mostly Muslim asylum-seekers as a stand to preserve Europe as a Christian continent. But after a column of migrants more than a mile long streamed onto Hungary’s main highway to Austria, it appeared that authorities felt they had no alternative but to pass the challenge to their neighbor, another country that has been ambivalent about the influx. By early Saturday morning, the first asylum seekers began to walk across the border into Austria after having been dropped off by buses on the Hungarian side. The buses had picked people up at Budapest's main train station. After initial hesitation, the crowds began to climb on board, relieved to be en route out of Hungary.  At Keleti train station in Budapest, where thousands of migrants had camped out for nearly a week, the central plaza was nearly empty on Saturday morning except for a maintenance crew hosing down the site.   The Hungarian decision to provide up to 100 buses to take the asylum-seekers to the border did little to resolve the challenge facing Europe, which has failed to come up with a unified response to the mounting numbers on its borders. Instead, the plans simply shifted the crisis to another state, leaving the fundamental problem — a bloc of 503 million people unable to agree whether and how to house several hundred thousand refugees — to burn for another day. “The European Union has proved to be inadequate to address the situation,” Janos Lazar, the Hungarian prime minister’s chief of staff, said in an address in parliament. He said that the decision had been made to clear the roads to ensure the country’s transportation security.   Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said that he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel had agreed to take in the asylum-seekers that Hungary was moving to the border. “On the basis of today’s emergency at the Hungarian border, Austria and Germany are allowing an onward journey of the refugees into their countries in this instance,” Faymann said in a statement on his Facebook page. But he suggested that it was a one-time agreement, leaving the broader issue unresolved In recent days, Hungarian authorities had tried to halt the asylum-seekers’ journey by stopping rail traffic, penning them in migrant camps and bolstering security at the border. A tense day-long standoff on a halted train about 20 miles west of Budapest ended after many of the train’s occupants stormed police lines and walked to the highway to join a larger group that had already started out from Budapest. Others — mostly women and children — agreed to go to a nearby migration processing camp. More than 1,000 asylum-seekers walked on the shoulder of the highway as trucks whizzed by Friday night. Fathers carried sleeping toddlers on their shoulders. Old men hobbled on canes. Near the front of the crowd, one man waved a blue and gold European Union flag.        1 of 40       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                              Sept. 4, 2015                                                            Skip Ad   ×           Refugees leave Hungarian train station on foot toward Austria      View Photos   Hundreds of refugees frustrated at being stuck at two train stations in Hungary set off for Austria, one group forming a line nearly a half-mile long as they streamed out of Budapest, the other breaking out of a train near a migrant reception center.

Her 10-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son walked alongside. Kaman said she hoped to go to Sweden, where authorities have promised permanent residency to Syrian refugees. Her daughter sobbed beside her, saying she was exhausted. “I know,” Kaman said, “but we have to keep going.”  [Smuggling refugees into Europe is a new growth industry]  Amid the chaos, the debate over how to respond to Europe’s refugee crisis continued to escalate. Hungarian lawmakers, fearful of the influx of asylum-seekers from conflict-torn Middle Eastern nations, approved measures Friday that gave authorities sweeping powers to seal the border and detain migrants who crossed the 108-mile razor-wire fence that was recently erected across the frontier with Serbia. “The reality is that Europe is threatened by a mass inflow of people. Many tens of millions of people could come to Europe,” Orban said Friday on Hungarian national radio. “Now we talk about hundreds of thousands, but next year we will talk about millions, and there is no end to this,” the prime minister said. “All of a sudden we will see that we are in a minority in our own continent.” Hungarian leaders had said they were simply following E.U. regulations in their harsh response, so tough that they declined U.N. offers of emergency aid for the migrants. But the rules have proved radically inadequate for the situation because they place most of the burden of dealing with asylum-seekers on the first E.U. country they enter. That has forced poorer countries such as Greece, Hungary and Italy to the forefront as many richer ones have taken a back seat. The vast majority of asylum-seekers arriving in Hungary simply want to move on to Germany and Sweden, but leaders there have said they cannot shoulder the full burden of the arrivals. Instead, migrants have gathered in the subterranean passages near Budapest’s main train station as they plot their next move. Hungary’s nationalist government enjoys broad public support. But not all citizens are opposed to the asylum-seekers. “My stomach is shaking when I see these little kids,” said Attila Gadl, who drove his minivan to the roadside to hand out loaves of bread, water and reflective vests to the crowds straggling by. Many countries have refused to commit to mandatory targets for taking in refugees. Central European leaders convening in Prague said they would not support a joint German and French proposal to institute quotas that would require each European Union nation to take a designated number of refugees. Many nations have been less willing to accept asylum-seekers than Germany, which has said it expects 800,000 this year. Slovakia, for example, has said it will take only Christians. On Friday, British Prime Minister David Cameron reversed a pledge not to take more refugees, citing “the scale of the crisis and the suffering of people.” He said that his nation would accept “thousands” from the packed camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan, where millions of people have been displaced by Syria’s civil war, and that he would offer more details next week.  [Hungary’s maverick prime minister becomes Europe’s Donald Trump]   The package of measures approved Friday by Hungary’s parliament made crossing or damaging the border fence a criminal offense, punishable by up to three years in prison. Hungarian authorities will also be able to set up migrant camps at the frontier, where asylum-seekers can be confined as their requests are processed. Orban aims to seal the border by Sept. 15. The pressure is rapidly building as record numbers of asylum-seekers reach Europe’s shores faster than authorities can decide what to do with them. Riots broke out Friday on the Greek island of Lesvos, where more than 1,000 migrants tried to board a packed ferry for mainland Greece. Police used stun grenades to push them back. Authorities think that more than 15,000 asylum-seekers are on the tourist island, but there are facilities for far fewer. The U.N. refugee agency said Friday that nearly 5,600 people crossed from Greece to Macedonia a day earlier, double the figures that had been seen in recent days. Those numbers were already unprecedented. “The only ones who benefit from the lack of a common European response are the smugglers and traffickers who are making profit from people’s desperation to reach safety,” U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees António Guterres said Friday in a statement. He said Europe needed to make as many as 200,000 spots for new refugees. Plans circulating in Brussels appear far less generous.  [The saga of the Syrian family whose 3-year-old turned up dead on a Turkish beach]   The drowning death of a Syrian toddler, 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi, galvanized global emotions this week after images of his body washing up on a Turkish coast went viral. He was buried Friday alongside his mother, Rehan, and brother, Ghalib, in their native Kobane. Despite Europe’s harsh reception, many asylum-seekers said they remained optimistic. “I will get there. I need this,” said Fatima Hamido, 24, an art and English teacher in her native Latakia, Syria, who nearly made it to the Austrian border in a smuggler’s van before it broke down and Hungarian authorities brought her back to a camp near Budapest. “This is the only way.”  Birnbaum reported from Brussels.

At U.N. headquarters in New York on Monday, E.U. foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told the Security Council that the unprecedented flow of migrants seeking to reach Europe by crossing the Mediterranean has necessitated “an exceptional response.” “We cannot do it alone. This has to be a common global effort. That’s why we count on your support to save lives and dismantle criminal organizations that are exploiting people’s desperation,” Mogherini told the 15-nation council. The E.U. proposal would allow the bloc to deploy military force to seize and destroy smugglers’ ships before they take on their human cargo.  [3 reasons why Europe is being held responsible for migrant deaths in the Mediterranean]  E.U. leaders see the program as an essential step to curb the dangerous crossings, which have left 1,800 people dead this year as the packed and poorly maintained ships have sunk, run aground or overturned on the high seas. The death toll is 20 times as high as it was at this time last year. But it is unclear whether the E.U. can win Security Council support. Russia has said it opposes any attempt to destroy smugglers’ ships, arguing that the owners in many cases do not know the purpose for which the vessels are being used. Authorities in Libya, the anarchic and divided nation that is the primary source of migrant smuggling, have been either cool to the idea or openly hostile. Rights groups, meanwhile, say that a focus on military action will not solve the crisis, and may make it worse. Amnesty International released a report Monday that described horrendous living conditions for migrants in Libya and concluded that military efforts would “effectively contribute to migrants and refugees being trapped in Libya and expose them to a risk of serious human rights abuses.” The group urged Tunisia and Egypt to open their borders to migrants seeking an escape from Libya, allowing them a safer route out than the one by sea.  [Map: Hundreds presumed lost at sea]  The E.U. has been roundly criticized for not doing enough to stem the crisis, which is being fed by an exodus of people from Africa and the Middle East fleeing war, poverty and oppression. An Italian-run search-and-rescue mission estimated to have saved more than 100,000 lives was canceled last year. After more than 800 people died in a single shipwreck last month, E.U. officials voted to triple funding for a new maritime patrol mission, though it remains more limited in scope than its predecessor. Meanwhile, an E.U. proposal to more evenly distribute asylum-seekers across Europe appeared to be in trouble Monday, even before it is due to be officially unveiled. The European Commission is expected to release the plan on Wednesday. It calls for establishing E.U.-wide quotas that would dictate the minimum number of asylum-seekers accepted by each of the union’s 28 members. The idea is to ease the burden on front-line states along Europe’s southern periphery, which are suffering under the strain of the tens of thousands of migrants seeking entry. The proposal is strongly backed by those countries and by Germany, which registers more asylum applications than any other nation in Europe. But it has been vigorously opposed by several East European nations, as well as by Britain, where the Conservative government is under intense pressure to limit immigration. A British government spokesman, speaking Monday under customary rules of anonymity, cited previous statements by Prime Minister David Cameron that Britain “would be playing its role in tackling the current crisis in the Mediterranean but that our focus would be on saving lives, not offering people asylum in the U.K.”  Read more:   U.N. estimates up to 850 migrants perished in capsized boat off Libya   Why the Mediterranean migrant disaster is a problem for Israel, too   Amid flood of refugees to Europe, Italy opens a back door  "}

A day after Hungary temporarily halted rail traffic at Budapest’s central station, at least 2,000 asylum seekers remained locked out, as Hungarian authorities refused to let them travel onward to Austria and Germany. Several hundred staged impromptu demonstrations, shouting “Freedom! Freedom!” and demanding that they be allowed to use the tickets that many had already purchased for hundreds of euros. Riot police looked on warily as the protests continued into the evening. Meanwhile, across the continent, passengers on the Eurostar service between Britain and France were stranded for hours overnight and two trains turned back as authorities searched for migrants who had been reported on the tracks and atop train carriages.   The delays disrupted travel for as many as 2,000 passengers and were the latest in a summer in which migrants have frequently ventured onto tracks near the Channel Tunnel in the French port city of Calais, trying to stow away on trains bound for Britain. The impact on transit systems reflected the scale of the crisis confronting European leaders as hundreds of thousands of refugees have arrived seeking sanctuary from conflict, oppression and poverty in the Middle East, South Asia and Africa. Policymakers have called an emergency summit for Sept. 14 at which European Union leaders are planning to push for a more coordinated effort by the union’s 28 member states. The plans are expected to include a system for dispersing refugees more equitably across the continent, as well as rules for determining which migrants should be returned to their home countries because they fail to meet the definition of refugees. But rights advocates say the E.U. also needs to implement safe and legal routes to the continent to allow refugees to avoid perilous and often deadly journeys.   [Read The Post’s coverage on the global surge in migration]  The latest deaths were reported Wednesday when 12 migrants drowned after two boats capsized in the narrow strait between Turkey and the Greek island of Kos, Turkish police said.   The migrant crisis in Europe is worsening, with thousands flooding into Hungary everyday. Migrants have not been permitted to leave as their paperwork is processed and officials draw up plans to spread them out across Europe. (Reuters)   The deaths highlighted the growing hazards of what had until recently been one of the safer routes to Europe because of the relatively brief sea journey. A photo of a Syrian toddler whose body washed up on the Turkish coast hours after the sinkings circulated widely online. A second photo showed a solemn policeman cradling the boy, who was dressed in a red T-shirt, shorts and sneakers. “Despite only being a few short miles, as we have seen, the open-sea journey from Turkey to Greece is far from safe and will only become more dangerous as the weather turns this autumn,” said Kirk Day, field director for the International Rescue Committee, in a statement. “With an estimated 200,000 refugees still planning to make the journey to Greece this year, it is inevitable that we will see a further loss of life until Europe’s policies change.” The European border control agency Frontex said 23,000 migrants arrived in Greece last week alone — a 50 percent increase over the previous week. The total for the year in Greece is more than 200,000. The vast majority of the migrants have no intention of staying in Greece but plan to travel north through the Balkans, Hungary and Austria to settle in northern European countries such as Germany and Sweden. Germany has said it expects 800,000 asylum applications this year and has called for other countries to take up more of the burden. But British Prime Minister David Cameron signaled Wednesday that his country would not necessarily comply. Britain has resettled just 216 Syrian refugees since the war began, in addition to nearly 5,000 others who have traveled to the island nation on their own. Despite growing pressure from opposition politicians and fellow European leaders for those numbers to be expanded, Cameron said Wednesday that Britain would continue to focus on foreign aid rather than refugee resettlement. “I don’t think there is an answer that can be achieved simply by taking more and more refugees,” he told the BBC.

There was no sign Monday that the crisis was easing, with Britain and France — two nations criticized for not doing enough — pledging to take in tens of thousands of asylum seekers. But Germany — the nation taking in the lion’s share, an estimated 800,000 by year’s end — continued to lead the way, pledging to hire 3,000 more police officers and spend $6.7 billion more to address the crisis, including emergency housing for 150,000 people. Yet even as German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her nation should be “proud” of its response, other European leaders and domestic critics blamed Germany, as well as similarly generous nations such as Sweden, for offering benefits so lucrative that they had become an incentive for asylum seekers to risk their lives over land and sea. The sniping came as the pace of arrivals accelerated Monday. In Greece, the refugees’ first port of call, authorities requested emergency European Union assistance as islands received asylum seekers faster than they could be ferried to the mainland. Greece’s coast guard said it had rescued more than 2,000 asylum seekers in the Mediterranean Sea since Friday. And hundreds of migrants scuffled with Hungarian authorities on the border with Serbia before pushing into the country on foot. Germany responded to the criticism Monday by announcing a reduction in cash handouts for asylum seekers during their initial months of processing, instead saying it would offer them more food stamps and in-kind aid. Berlin also said it would push to have western Balkan countries such as Kosovo declared “safe” in a bid to weed out the many thousands of migrants now claiming asylum from countries not at war.        1 of 69       Full Screen Autoplay  Close                                                                                                                                                                 Skip Ad   ×           Migrants’ desperate quest to cross into Europe      View Photos   More than 332,000 people have reached Europe so far this year.

Referring to criticisms by European leaders including Britain’s David Cameron and Hungary’s Viktor Orban, he said, “I can’t say that Orban or Cameron are completely wrong.” In the crowded refugee centers across this nation of 81 million, asylum seekers have conceded that they have come to Germany because it is doing more to help than other nations in the region. Mohammed Mazher Alkilany, 28, a former PR consultant for the Damascus tourism board who is living in a temporary shelter in east Berlin, said his family of three is living on 233 euros a month provided by the government — a sum he described as too little to cover the cost of warm clothes and blankets for the coming winter. But they are also living in free temporary housing in a building outfitted with a playground and rooms with shared kitchens, bathrooms and washing machines. He insisted, though, that he did not come to Germany simply for its generous benefits. “I came here because Germany is safe; there is no war,” he said. “Germany is the best in Europe. France is no good, you cannot get language classes there, but in Germany you can learn the language for free.” Although Sweden is offering similar aid, he said it was “too far away, it is very cold, and it is always night there.” A few European nations have been willing to set up operations to legally and safely bring, for example, Syrian refugees directly from bordering nations such as Turkey and Lebanon. But they have put strict limits on numbers, with all 28 E.U. nations offering just over 53,000 such spots since 2013, according to U.N. figures. That is a drop in the ocean compared with the more than 4 million Syrian refugees.   Instead, European nations have preferred to deal with ­asylum seekers only at the point when they are politically forced to — after the refugees physically cross their borders. Analysts say that a shift in policy would reduce the incentives to make the dangerous voyage to Europe’s shores but that there was little political support for such an effort. Cameron announced Monday that Britain would resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees directly from the Middle East over the next five years — a figure equal to the number of asylum seekers Germany took in over the weekend. Cameron, however, said Britain was nevertheless acting with “head and heart” by accepting refugees only from camps around the Syrian border, while seemingly taking a jab at nations such as Germany for encouraging illegal trips by accepting so many. “We want to encourage people not to make that dangerous crossing in the first place,” Cameron said. Up to now, Britain has resettled only 216 Syrian refugees through its government program. The scant opportunities to obtain visas on the ground near the Syrian conflict were dramatized by the drowning death last week of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who had family in Canada but whose parents had been unable to get family reunification visas that would have given them a legal route out of Turkey. Instead, they tried to reach Greece by boat, with tragic consequences. “We would prefer that no refugee would have to take that dangerous journey to have to reach safety in Europe,” said Melissa Fleming, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Under a European Commission proposal to be released Wednesday, reception camps would be set up in Italy, Greece and Hungary to route new arrivals to other European countries. That could eliminate most of the risky overland legs of the journey. But the incentives to set sail from Turkey, Libya or Egypt would remain. French President François Hollande said Monday that his nation stood ready to take in 24,000 refugees as part of the plan. Spain’s El Pais newspaper published leaked numbers that show Germany taking more than 31,000, while Spain would take in nearly 15,000. Other countries would take in far fewer. The debate over whether Germany is being too generous came as more European politicians are questioning the open-door approach. “Just between us, you know, the problem is not a European problem. The problem is a German problem,” Orban said last week after negotiations with E.U. leaders. In France, which has struggled with how to respond to the influx, far-right leader Marine Le Pen took a pot shot at Berlin’s efforts. “Germany is probably thinking of its moribund demographics, and it is probably trying to lower salaries again and to continue to recruit slaves via massive immigration,” she told a meeting of her National Front party. The move in Germany to reduce cash handouts for asylum seekers came as the country is also seeking to rapidly expel those who do not qualify. During the first six months of this year, for instance, about 45 percent of people seeking asylum in Germany were Europeans from the Balkans. Overall, however, Germany is dramatically ramping up its spending on the crisis, with the nation preparing for years, if not generations, of societal change from the arrival of so many newcomers. “What we are experiencing now is something that will continue to preoccupy and change our country in the coming years,” Merkel said Monday. “And we want it to change in a positive way. And we think we can make that happen.”  Birnbaum reported from Brussels. Stephanie Kirchner in Berlin and Karla Adam in London contributed to this report.

At a train station in southern Moravia, Czech police pulled 200 refugees off a train and marked numbers on their arms. On its eastern border, Hungary is building a barbed-wire fence to keep out refugees, remarkably like the barbed wire “iron curtain” that once marked its western border. Choose whatever image you want — ships full of Jews being sent back to Nazi Europe, refugees furtively negotiating with smugglers at a bar in Casablanca — and it now has a modern twist.  Anne Applebaum writes a biweekly foreign affairs column for The Washington Post. She is also the Director of the Global Transitions Program at the Legatum Institute in London. View Archive   Facebook RSS   As happens so often, crocodile tears are falling. The Sun, a British tabloid, has spent a decade railing against immigrants of all kinds. Not long ago, it told the British prime minister to “Draw a Red Line on Immigration — Or Else.” Now, after the publication of photographs of a dead Syrian toddler washed up on a Turkish beach, it wants him to “Deal With the Worst Crisis Facing Europe Since WW2.” Having just declared that there was no point in accepting “more and more refugees,” poor David Cameron has now declared that, actually, Britain would accept more and more refugees. His aides hurriedly explained that “he had not seen the photographs” when he made the original statement. More layers of hypocrisy: Although the photographs are indeed terrible, they aren’t actually telling us anything new. Refugees have been crossing the Mediterranean for months. Hundreds have died. Also, if we are disturbed by a dead child on a beach, why aren’t we disturbed by another dead child in a bombed-out house in Aleppo, Syria? What’s the distinction? Even now, almost all of the slogans being bandied about as “solutions” are based on false assumptions. Nations should accept real refugees but not economic migrants? For one, it’s rarely easy to tell the difference. More to the point, the number of potentially “legitimate” refugees is staggeringly high. As of July, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees had registered more than 4 million Syrian refugees, of whom well over a million are in Turkey and 1.5 million are in Lebanon, a country of only 4.8 million people. That’s not counting Iraqis, Libyans, Afghans and others who have equally suffered political or religious persecution, or even the millions of displaced Syrians still in Syria. Exactly how many of them will Europe take? It gets worse: The law says refugees should “declare themselves in the first European Union country they enter” and then apply for asylum according to E.U. law. That’s all very well for, say, Ireland. But what happens when tens of thousands of people board boats in Tripoli and start heading for Italy or Greece? Now we know: Those two countries have been pleading for assistance from their neighbors for many months, to no avail. And when Hungary can’t cope with the numbers? We’ve just learned: The refugees become a prop for Viktor Orban , the Hungarian prime minister, who has a fondness for dramatic scenes. Orban was correct in one of his inflammatory statements: The refugees don’t want to stay in Hungary. They want to go to Germany, mostly because the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has made sympathetic noises, has offered to take more Syrians and has called on others to do the same. The Hungarians, by contrast, have greeted refugees with pepper spray and made them camp out at the Budapest train station (For history buffs, another irony: At one point, refugees started chanting “Germany, Germany!”) But if those praising Merkel’s “brave” stance were honest, they would acknowledge that she isn’t offering any long-term solutions either.
